    <h2>
      CHAPTER I &mdash; COUNT VICTOR COMES TO A STRANGE COUNTRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was an afternoon in autumn, with a sound of wintry breakers on the
      shore, the tall woods copper-colour, the thickets dishevelled, and the
      nuts, in the corries of Ardkinglas, the braes of Ardno, dropping upon
      bracken burned to gold. Until he was out of the glen and into the open
      land, the traveller could scarcely conceive that what by his chart was no
      more than an arm of the ocean could make so much ado; but when he found
      the incoming tide fretted here and there by black rocks, and elsewhere, in
      little bays, the beaches strewn with massive boulders, the high rumour of
      the sea-breakers in that breezy weather seemed more explicable. And still,
      for him, it was above all a country of appalling silence in spite of the
      tide thundering. Fresh from the pleasant rabble of Paris, the tumult of
      the streets, the unending gossip of the faubourgs that were at once his
      vexation and his joy, and from the eager ride that had brought him through
      Normandy when its orchards were busy from morning till night with cheerful
      peasants plucking fruit, his ear had not grown accustomed to the still of
      the valleys, the terrific hush of the mountains, in whose mist or sunshine
      he had ridden for two days. The woods, with leaves that fell continually
      about him, seemed in some swoon of nature, with no birds carolling on the
      boughs; the cloisters were monastic in their silence. A season of most
      dolorous influences, a land of sombre shadows and ravines, a day of
      sinister solitude; the sun slid through scudding clouds, high over a world
      blown upon by salt airs brisk and tonic, but man was wanting in those
      weary valleys, and the heart of Victor Jean, Comte de Montaiglon, was
      almost sick for very loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came as a relief to his ear, the removal of an oppression little
      longer to be endured, when he heard behind him what were apparently the
      voices of the odd-looking uncouth natives he had seen a quarter of an hour
      ago lurking, silent but alert and peering, phantoms of old story rather
      than humans, in the fir-wood near a defile made by a brawling cataract.
      They had wakened no suspicions in his mind. It was true they were
      savage-looking rogues in a ragged plaid-cloth of a dull device, and they
      carried arms he had thought forbidden there by law. To a foreigner fresh
      from gentle lands there might well be a menace in their ambuscade, but he
      had known men of their race, if not of so savage an aspect, in the
      retinues of the Scots exiles who hung about the side-doors of Saint
      Germains, passed mysterious days between that domicile of tragic comedy
      and Avignon or Rome, or ruffled it on empty pockets at the gamingtables,
      so he had no apprehension. Besides, he was in the country of the Argyll,
      at least on the verge of it, a territory accounted law-abiding even to
      dul-ness by every Scot he had known since he was a child at Cammercy, and
      snuff-strewn conspirators, come to meet his uncles, took him on their
      knees when a lull in the cards or wine permitted, and recounted their
      adventures for his entertainment in a villainous French: he could not
      guess that the gentry in the wood behind him had taken a fancy to his
      horse, that they were broken men (as the phrase of the country put it),
      and that when he had passed them at the cataract&mdash;a haughty,
      well-setup <i>duine uasail</i> all alone with a fortune of silk and silver
      lace on his apparel and the fob of a watch dangling at his groin most
      temptingly&mdash;they had promptly put a valuation upon himself and his
      possessions, and decided that the same were sent by Providence for their
      enrichment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten of them ran after him clamouring loudly to give the impression of
      larger numbers; he heard them with relief when oppressed by the inhuman
      solemnity of the scenery that was too deep in its swoon to give back even
      an echo to the breaker on the shore, and he drew up his horse, turned his
      head a little and listened, flushing with annoyance when the rude calls of
      his pursuers became, even in their unknown jargon, too plainly peremptory
      and meant for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish I had a chance to open school here and teach
      manners,&rdquo; and without more deliberation he set his horse to an amble,
      designed to betray neither complacency nor a poltroon's terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Stad! stad!</i>&rdquo; cried a voice closer than any of the rest behind him;
      he knew what was ordered by its accent, but no Montaiglon stopped to an
      insolent summons. He put the short rowels to the flanks of the sturdy
      lowland pony he bestrode, and conceded not so little as a look behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the explosion of a bell-mouthed musket, and something smote the
      horse spatteringly behind the rider's left boot. The beast swerved, gave a
      scream of pain, fell lumberingly on its side. With an effort, Count Victor
      saved himself from the falling body and clutched his pistols. For a moment
      he stood bewildered at the head of the suffering animal. The pursuing
      shouts had ceased. Behind him, short hazel-trees clustering thick with
      nuts, reddening bramble, and rusty bracken, tangled together in a coarse
      rank curtain of vegetation, quite still and motionless (but for the breeze
      among the upper leaves), and the sombre distance, dark with pine, had the
      mystery of a vault. It was difficult to believe his pursuers harboured
      there, perhaps reloading the weapon that had put so doleful a conclusion
      to his travels with the gallant little horse he had bought on the coast of
      Fife. That silence, that prevailing mystery, seemed to be the essence and
      the mood of this land, so different from his own, where laughter was
      ringing in the orchards and a myriad towns and clamant cities brimmed with
      life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II &mdash; THE PURSUIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nobody who had acquaintance with Victor de Montaiglon would call him
      coward. He had fought with De Grammont, and brought a wound from Dettingen
      under circumstances to set him up for life in a repute for valour, and
      half a score of duels were at his credit or discredit in the chronicles of
      Paris society.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, somehow, standing there in an unknown country beside a brute
      companion wantonly struck down by a robber's shot, and the wood so still
      around, and the thundering sea so unfamiliar, he felt vastly
      uncomfortable, with a touch of more than physical apprehension. If the
      enemy would only manifest themselves to the eye and ear as well as to the
      unclassed senses that inform the instinct, it would be much more
      comfortable. Why did they not appear? Why did they not follow up their
      assault upon his horse? Why were they lurking in the silence of the
      thicket, so many of them, and he alone and so obviously at their mercy?
      The pistols he held provided the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a rare delicacy!&rdquo; said Count Victor, applying himself to the release
      of his mail from the saddle whereto it was strapped. &ldquo;They would not
      interrupt my regretful tears. But for the true élan of the trade of
      robbery, give me old Cartouche picking pockets on the Pont Neuf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he loosened the bag with one hand, with the other he directed at the
      thicket one of the pistols that seemed of such wholesome influence. Then
      he slung the bag upon his shoulder and encouraged the animal to get upon
      its legs, but vainly, for the shot was fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he regretfully, &ldquo;I must sacrifice my bridge and my good
      comrade. This is an affair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twice&mdash;three times, he placed the pistol at the horse's head and as
      often withdrew it, reluctant, a man, as all who knew him wondered at,
      gentle to womanliness with a brute, though in a cause against men the most
      bitter and sometimes cruel of opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rustle in the brake at last compelled him. &ldquo;Allons!&rdquo; said he impatiently
      with himself, &ldquo;I do no more than I should have done with me in the like
      case,&rdquo; and he pulled the trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then having deliberately charged the weapon anew, he moved off in the
      direction he had been taking when the attack was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still, he knew, some distance to the castle. Half an hour before
      his rencontre with those broken gentry, now stealing in his rear with the
      cunning and the bloodthirstiness of their once native wolves (and always,
      remember, with the possibility of the blunderbuss for aught that he could
      tell), he had, for the twentieth time since he left the port of Dysart,
      taken out the rude itinerary, written in ludicrous Scoto-English by Hugh
      Bethune, one time secretary to the Lord Marischal in exile, and read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ... and so on to the Water of Leven (the brewster-wife at the howff near
      Loch Lomond mouth keeps a good glass of <i>aqua</i>) then by Luss (with an
      eye on the Gregarach), there after a bittock to Glencroe and down upon the
      House of Ardkinglas, a Hanoverian rat whom 'ware. Round the loch head and
      three miles further the Castle o' the Baron. Give him my devoirs and hopes
      to challenge him to a Bowl when Yon comes off which God kens there seems
      no hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that showing the castle of Baron Lamond must be within half an hour's
      walk of where he now moved without show of eagerness, yet quickly none the
      less, from a danger the more alarming because the extent of it could not
      be computed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little the rough path he followed bent parallel with the sea. A tide
      at the making licked ardently upon sand-spits strewn with ware, and at the
      forelands, overhung by harsh and stunted seaside shrubs, the breakers rose
      tumultuous. On the sea there was utter vacancy; only a few screaming birds
      slanted above the wave, and the coast, curving far before him, gave his
      eye no sign at first of the castle to which he had got the route from M.
      Hugh Bethune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his vision, that had been set for something more imposing, for the
      towers and embrasures of a stately domicile, if not for a Chantilly, at
      least for the equal of the paternal château in the Meuse valley, with
      multitudinous chimneys and the incense of kind luxuriant hearths, suave
      parks, gardens, and gravelled walks, contracted with dubiety and amazement
      upon a dismal tower perched upon a promontory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revealed against the brown hills and the sombre woods of the farther
      coast, it was scarcely a wonder that his eye had failed at first to find
      it. Here were no pomps of lord or baron; little luxuriance could prevail
      behind those eyeless gables; there could be no suave pleasance about those
      walls hanging over the noisy and inhospitable wave. No pomp, no pleasant
      amenities; the place seemed to jut into the sea, defying man's oldest and
      most bitter enemy, its gable ends and one crenelated bastion or turret
      betraying its sinister relation to its age, its whole aspect arrogant and
      unfriendly, essential of war. Caught suddenly by the vision that swept the
      fretted curve of the coast, it seemed blackly to perpetuate the spirit of
      the land, its silence, its solitude and terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections darted through the mind of Count Victor as he sped,
      monstrously uncomfortable with the burden of the bag that bobbed on his
      back, not to speak of the indignity of the office. It was not the kind of
      castle he had looked for, but a castle, in the narrow and squalid meaning
      of a penniless refugee like Bethune, it doubtless was, the only one
      apparent on the landscape, and therefore too obviously the one he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, God is good!&rdquo; said Count Victor, who, to tell all and leave no
      shred of misunderstanding, was in some regards the frankest of pagans, and
      he must be jogging on for its security.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he hurried, the ten broken men who had been fascinated by his too
      ostentatious fob and the extravagance of his embroidery, and inspired
      furthermore by a natural detestation of any foreign <i>duine uasail</i>
      apparently bound for the seat of MacCailen Mor, gathered boldness, and
      soon he heard the thicket break again behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, turned sharply with the pistols in his hands. Instantly the
      wood enveloped his phantom foes; a bracken or two nodded, a hazel sapling
      swung back and forward more freely than the wind accounted for. And at the
      same time there rose on the afternoon the wail of a wild fowl high up on
      the hill, answered in a sharp and querulous too-responsive note of the
      same character in the wood before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman who had twice fought <i>à la barrière</i> felt a nameless
      new thrill, a shudder of the being, born of antique terrors generations
      before his arms were quartered with those of Rochefoucauld and Modene.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was becoming all too awkward, this affair. He broke into a more rapid
      walk, then into a run, with his eyes intent upon the rude dark keep that
      held the promontory, now the one object in all the landscape that had to
      his senses some aspect of human fellowship and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caterans were assured; <i>Dieu du ciel</i>, how they ran too! Those in
      advance broke into an appalling halloo, the shout of hunters on the heels
      of quarry. High above the voice of the breakers it sounded savage and
      alarming in the ears of Count Victor, and he fairly took to flight, the
      valise bobbing more ludicrously than ever on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the man that, in spite of dreads not to be concealed from
      himself, he should be seized as he sped with a notion of the grotesque
      figure he must present, carrying that improper burden. He must even laugh
      when he thought of his, austere punctilious maternal aunt, the Baronne de
      Chenier, and fancied her horror and disgust could she behold her nephew
      disgracing the De Chenier blood by carrying his own baggage and outraging
      several centuries of devilishly fine history by running&mdash;positively
      running&mdash;from ill-armed footpads who had never worn breeches. She
      would frown, her bosom would swell till her bodice would appear to crackle
      at the armpits, the seven hairs on her upper lip would bristle all the
      worse against her purpling face as she cried it was the little Lyons
      shopkeeper in his mother's grandfather that was in his craven legs. Doubt
      it who will, an imminent danger will not wholly dispel the sense of
      humour, and Montàiglon, as he ran before the footpads, laughed softly at
      the Baronne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a short knife with a black hilt hissed past his right ear and buried
      three-fourths of its length in the grass, and so abruptly spoiled the
      comedy. This was ridiculous. He stopped suddenly, turned him round about
      in a passion, and fired one of the pistols at an unfortunate robber too
      late to duck among the bracken. And the marvel was that the bullet found
      its home, for the aim was uncertain, and the shot meant more for an
      emphatic protest than for attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gled's cry rose once more, rose higher on the hill, echoed far off,
      and was twice repeated nearer head with a drooping melancholy cadence.
      Gaunt forms grew up straight among the undergrowth of trees, indifferent
      to the other pistol, and ran back or over to where the wounded comrade
      lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven's thunder!&rdquo; cried Count Victor, &ldquo;I wish I had aimed more
      carefully.&rdquo; He was appalled at the apparent tragedy of his act. A suicidal
      regret and curiosity kept him standing where he fired, with the pistol
      still smoking in his hand, till there came from the men clustered round
      the body in the brake a loud simultaneous wail unfamiliar to his ear, but
      unmistakable in its import. He turned and ran wildly for the tower that
      had no aspect of sanctuary in it; his heart drummed noisily at his breast;
      his mouth parched and gaped. Upon his lips in a little dropped water; he
      tasted the salt of his sweating body. And then he knew weariness, great
      weariness, that plucked at the sinews behind his knees, and felt sore
      along the hips and back, the result of his days of hard riding come
      suddenly to the surface. Truly he was not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he ran wearily he ran well, better at least than his pursuers, who
      had their own reasons for taking it more leisurely, and in a while there
      was neither sight nor sound of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to get some satisfaction from this, when, turning a bend
      of the path within two hundred yards of the castle, behold an unmistakable
      enemy barred his way!&mdash;an ugly, hoggish, obese man, with bare legs
      most grotesquely like pillars of granite, and a protuberant paunch; but
      the devil must have been in his legs to carry him more swiftly than
      thoroughbred limbs had borne Count Victor. He stood sneering in the path,
      turning up the right sleeve of a soiled and ragged saffron shirt with his
      left hand, the right being engaged most ominously with a sword of a
      fashion that might well convince the Frenchman he had some new methods of
      fence to encounter in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      High and low looked Count Victor as he slacked his pace, seeking for some
      way out of this sack, releasing as he did so the small sword from the
      tanglement of his skirts, feeling the Mechlin deucedly in his way. As he
      approached closer to the man barring his path he relapsed into a walk and
      opened a parley in English that except for the slightest of accents had
      nothing in it of France, where he had long been the comrade of compatriots
      to this preposterous savage with the manners of medieval Provence when
      footpads lived upon Damoiselle Picoree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said he airily, as one might open with a lackey, &ldquo;I
      protest I am in a hurry, for my presence makes itself much desired
      elsewhere. I cannot comprehend why in Heaven's name so large a regiment of
      you should turn out to one unfortunate traveller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat man fondled the brawn of his sword-arm and seemed to gloat upon
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Count Victor, affecting a cheerfulness, &ldquo;my waistcoat
      would scarcely adorn a man of your inches, and as for my pantaloons&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked at the ragged kilt&mdash;&ldquo;as for my pantaloons, now on one's
      honour, would you care for them? They are so essentially a matter of
      custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have bantered on in this strain up to the very nose of the enemy,
      but the man in his path was utterly unresponsive to his humour. In truth
      he did not understand a word of the nobleman's pleasantry. He uttered
      something like a war-cry, threw his bonnet off a head as bald as an egg,
      and smote out vigorously with his broadsword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor fired the pistol <i>à bout portant</i> with deliberation; the
      flint, in the familiar irony of fate, missed fire, and there was nothing
      more to do with the treacherous weapon but to throw it in the face of the
      Highlander. It struck full; the trigger-guard gashed the jaw and the
      metalled butt spoiled the sight of an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This accounts for the mace in the De Chenier quartering,&rdquo; thought the
      Count whimsically. &ldquo;It is obviously the weapon of the family.&rdquo; And he drew
      the rapier forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A favourite, a familiar arm, as the carriage of his head made clear at any
      time, he knew to use it with the instinct of the eyelash, but it seemed
      absurdly inadequate against the broad long weapon of his opponent, who had
      augmented his attack with a dirk drawn in the left hand, and sought
      lustily to bring death to his opponent by point as well as edge. A light
      dress rapier obviously must do its business quickly if it was not to
      suffer from the flailing blow of the claymore, and yet Count Victor did
      not wish to increase the evil impression of his first visit to this
      country by a second homicide, even in self-defence. He measured the
      paunched rascal with a rapid eye, and with a flick at the left wrist
      disarmed him of his poignard. Furiously the Gael thrashed with the sword,
      closing up too far on his opponent. Count Victor broke ground, beat an
      appeal that confused his adversary, lunged, and skewered him through the
      thick of the active arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Highlander dropped his weapon and bawled lamentably as he tried to
      staunch the copious blood; and safe from his further interference, Count
      Victor took to his heels again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the encounter with the obese and now discomfited Gael took place was
      within a hundred yards of the castle, whose basement and approach were
      concealed by a growth of stunted whin. Towards the castle Count Victor
      rushed, still hearing the shouts in the wood behind, and as he seemed, in
      spite of his burden, to be gaining ground upon his pursuers, he was elate
      at the prospect of escape. In his gladness he threw a taunting cry behind,
      a hunter's greenwood challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he came upon the edge of the sea. The sea! <i>Peste!</i> That he
      should never have thought of that! There was the castle, truly, beetling
      against the breakers, very cold, very arrogant upon its barren promontory.
      He was not twenty paces from its walls, and yet it might as well have been
      a league away, for he was cut off from it by a natural moat of sea-water
      that swept about it in yeasty little waves. It rode like a ship, oddly
      independent of aspect, self-contained, inviolable, eternally apart, for
      ever by nature indifferent to the mainland, where a Montaiglon was
      vulgarly quarrelling with <i>sans culottes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two he stood bewildered. There was no drawbridge to this
      eccentric moat; there was, on this side of the rock at least, not so
      little as a boat; if Lamond ever held intercourse with the adjacent isle
      of Scotland he must seemingly swim. Very well; the Count de Montaiglon,
      guilty of many outrages against his ancestry to-day, must swim too if that
      were called for. And it looked as if that were the only alternative.
      Vainly he called and whistled; no answer came from the castle, that he
      might have thought a deserted ruin if a column of smoke did not rise from
      some of its chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his one stroke of good fortune that for some reason the pursuit was
      no longer apparent. The dim woods behind seemed to have swallowed up sight
      and sound of the broken men, who, at fault, were following up their quarry
      to the castle of Mac-Cailen Mor instead of to that of Baron Lamond. He had
      therefore time to prepare himself for his next step. He sat on the shore
      and took off his elegant long boots, the quite charming silk stockings so
      unlike travel in the wilds; then looked dubiously at his limbs and at the
      castle. No! manifestly, an approach so frank was not to be thought of, and
      he compromised by unbuttoning the foot of his pantaloons and turning them
      over his knees. In any case, if one had to swim over that yeasty and
      alarming barrier, his clothing must get wet. <i>À porte basse, passant
      courbé</i>. He would wade as far as he could, and if he must, swim the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the boots and the valise and the stockings and the skirts of his coat
      tucked high in his arms, the Count waded into the tide, that chilled
      deliciously after the heat of his flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was ridiculous! It was the most condemnable folly! His face burned
      with shame as he found himself half-way over the channel and the waves no
      higher than his ankles. It was to walk through a few inches of water that
      he had nearly stripped to nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      And a woman was laughing at him, <i>morbleu!</i> Decidedly a woman was
      laughing&mdash;a young woman, he could wager, with a monstrously musical
      laugh, by St. Denys! and witnessing (though he could not see her even had
      he wished) this farce from an upper window of the tower. He stood for a
      moment irresolute, half inclined to retreat from the ridicule that never
      failed to affect him more unpleasantly than danger the most dire; his face
      and neck flamed; he forgot all about the full-bosomed Baronne or
      remembered her only to agree that nobility demanded some dignity even in
      fleeing from an enemy. But the shouts of the pursuers that had died away
      in the distance grew again in the neighbourhood, and he pocketed his
      diffidence and resumed his boots, then sought the entrance to a dwelling
      that had no hospitable portal to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close at hand the edifice gained in austerity and dignity while it lost
      the last of its scanty air of hospitality. Its walls were of a rough
      rubble of granite and whinstone, grown upon at the upper storeys with
      grasses and weeds wafted upon the ledges by the winds that blow
      indifferent, bringing the green messages of peace from God. A fortalice
      dark and square-built, flanked to the southern corner by a round turret,
      lit by few windows, and these but tiny and suspicious, it was as Scots and
      arrogant as the thistle that had pricked Count Victor's feet when first he
      set foot upon the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low wall surrounded a patch of garden-ground to the rear, one corner of
      it grotesquely adorned with a bower all bedraggled with rains, yet with
      the red berry of the dog-rose gleaming in the rusty leafage like grapes of
      fire. He passed through the little garden and up to the door. Its arch,
      ponderous, deep-moulded, hung a scowling eyebrow over the black and
      studded oak, and over all was an escutcheon with a blazon of hands
      fess-wise and castles embattled and the legend&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;Doom

     Man behauld the end of All.
     Be nocht Wiser than the Priest.
     Hope in God&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He stood on tiptoe to read the more easily the time-blurred characters,
      his baggage at his feet, his fingers pressed against the door. Some of the
      words he could not decipher nor comprehend, but the first was plain to his
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doom!&rdquo; said he airily and half aloud. &ldquo;Doom! <i>Quelle félicité!</i> It
      is an omen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rapped lightly on the oak with the pommel of his sword.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III &mdash; BARON OF DOOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Deep in some echoing corridor of the stronghold a man's voice rose in the
      Gaelic language, ringing in a cry for service, but no one came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor stepped back and looked again upon the storm-battered front,
      the neglected garden, the pathetic bower. He saw smoke but at a single
      chimney, and broken glass in the little windows, and other evidences that
      suggested meagre soup was common fare in Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Bethune's bowl,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;is not likely to be brimming
      over if he is to drink it here. M. le Baron shouting there is too much of
      the gentleman to know the way to the back of his own door; Glengarry again
      for a louis!&mdash;Glengarry <i>sans feu ni lieu</i>, but always the most
      punctilious when most nearly penniless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently he switched with the sword at the weeds about his feet; then
      reddened at the apprehension that had made him all unconsciously bare the
      weapon at a door whose hospitality he was seeking, rapped again, and
      sheathed the steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shuffling step sounded on the stones within, stopped apparently just
      inside the door, and there fell silence. No bolt moved, no chain clanked.
      But something informed the Count Victor that he was being observed, and he
      looked all over the door till he saw that one bolt-boss was missing about
      the height of his head and that through the hole an eye was watching him.
      It was the most absurd thing, and experiment with a hole in the door will
      not make plain the reason of it, but in that eye apparently little
      discomfited by the stranger having observed it, Count Victor saw its owner
      fully revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grey eye inquiring, an eye of middle age that had caution as well as
      humour. A domestic&mdash;a menial eye too, but for the life of him Count
      Victor could not resist smiling back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it disappeared and the door opened, showing on the threshold,
      with a stool in his hand, a very little bow-legged man of fifty years or
      thereby, having a face all lined, like a chart, with wrinkles, ruddy at
      the cheeks as a winter apple, and attired in a mulberry-brown. He put his
      heels together with a mechanical precision and gravely gave a military
      salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doom?&rdquo; inquired Count Victor formally, with a foot inside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jist that,&rdquo; answered the servitor a little dryly, and yet with a smile
      puckering his face as he put an opposing toe of a coarse unbuckled brogue
      under the instep of the stranger. The accent of the reply smacked of Fife;
      when he heard it, Count Victor at a leap was back in the port of Dysart,
      where it shrank beneath tall rocks, and he was hearing again for the first
      time with an amused wonder the native mariners crying to each other on the
      quays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your master at home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At hame, quo' he! It wad depend a'thegether on wha wants to ken,&rdquo; said
      the servant cautiously. Then in a manner ludicrously composed of natural
      geniality and burlesque importance, &ldquo;It's the auld styles aboot Doom, sir,
      though there's few o' us left to keep them up, and whether the Baron's oot
      or in is a thing that has to be studied maist scrupulously before the like
      o' me could say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is De Montaiglon; I am newly from France; I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step your ways in, Monsher de Montaiglon,&rdquo; cried the little man with a
      salute more profound than before. &ldquo;We're prood to see you, and hoo are
      they a' in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerably well, I thank you,&rdquo; said Count Victor, amused at this grotesque
      combination of military form and familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo Boyd set down the stool on which he had apparently been standing to
      look through the spy-hole in the door, and seized the stranger's bag. With
      three rapid movements of the feet, executed in the mechanical time of a
      soldier, he turned to the right about, paused a second, squared his
      shoulders, and led the way into a most barren and chilly interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, your honour,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ye'll paurdon my discretion, for it's a
      pernikity hoose this for a' the auld bauld, gallant forms and ceremonies.
      I jalouse ye came roond in a wherry frae the toon, and it's droll I never
      saw ye land. There was never mony got into Doom withoot the kennin' o' the
      garrison. It happened aince in Black Hugh's time wi' a corps o' Campbells
      frae Ardkinglas, and they found themselves in a wasp's byke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count stumbled in the dusk of the interior, for the door had shut of
      itself behind them, and the corridor was unlit except by what it borrowed
      from an open door at the far end, leading into a room. An odour of burning
      peats filled the place; the sound of the sea-breakers was to be heard in a
      murmur as one hears far-off and magic seas in a shell that is held to the
      ear. And Count Victor, finding all his pleasant anticipations of the
      character of this baronial dwelling utterly erroneous, mentally condemned
      Bethune to perdition as he stumbled behind the little grotesque aping the
      soldier's pompous manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door that lent what illumination there was to his entrance was held
      half open by a man who cast at the visitor a glance wherein were surprise
      and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Monsher de Montaiglon frae France,&rdquo; announced Mungo, stepping aside
      still with the soldier's mechanical precision, and standing by the door to
      give dignity to the introduction and the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron may have flushed for the overdone formality of his servant when
      he saw the style of his visitor, standing with a Kevenhuller cocked hat in
      one hand and fondling the upturned moustache with the other; something of
      annoyance at least was in his tone as he curtly dismissed the man and gave
      admission to the stranger, on whom he turned a questioning and slightly
      embarrassed countenance, handing him one of the few chairs in the most
      sparsely furnished of rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome, sir,&rdquo; he said simply in a literal rendering of his
      native Gaelic phrase; &ldquo;take your breath. And you will have refreshment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor protested no, but his host paid no heed. &ldquo;It is the custom of
      the country,&rdquo; said he, making for a cupboard and fumbling among glasses,
      giving, as by a good host's design, the stranger an opportunity of
      settling down to his new surroundings&mdash;a room ill-furnished as a
      monk's cell, lit by narrow windows, two of them looking to the sea and one
      along the coast, though not directly on it, windows sunk deep in massive
      walls built for a more bickering age than this. Count Victor took all in
      at a glance and found revealed to him in a flash the colossal mendacity of
      all the Camerons, Macgregors, and Macdonalds who had implied, if they had
      not deliberately stated, over many games of piquet or lansquenet at
      Cammercy, the magnificence of the typical Highland stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron had been reading; at least beside the chair drawn up to a fire
      of peat that perfumed the apartment lay a book upon a table, and it was
      characteristic of the Count, who loved books as he loved sport, and Villon
      above all, that he should strain his eyes a little and tilt his head
      slightly to see what manner of literature prevailed in these wilds. And
      the book gave him great cheer, for it was an old French folio of arms, &ldquo;<i>Les
      Arts de l'Homme d'Epée; ou, Le Dictionnaire du Gentilhomme</i>,&rdquo; by one
      Sieur de Guille. Doom Castle was a curious place, but apparently Hugh
      Bethune was in the right when he described its master as &ldquo;ane o' the auld
      gentry, wi' a tattie and herrin' to his déjeune, but a scholar's book open
      against the ale-jug.&rdquo; A poor Baron (of a vastly different state from the
      Baron of France), English spoken too, with not much of the tang of the
      heather in his utterance though droll of his idiom, hospitable (to judge
      from the proffered glass still being fumbled for in the cupboard), a man
      who had been in France on the right side, a reader of the <i>beau langage</i>,
      and a student of the lore of <i>arme blanche</i>&mdash;come, here was
      luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the man himself? He brought forward his spirits in a bottle of quaint
      Dutch cut, with hollow pillars at each of its four corners and two glasses
      extravagantly tall of stem, and he filled out the drams upon the table,
      removing with some embarrassment before he did so the book of arms. It
      surprised Count Victor that he should not be in the native tartan of the
      Scots Highlander. Instead he wore a demure coat and breeches of some dark
      fabric, and a wig conferred on him all the more of the look of a lowland
      merchant than of a chief of clan. He was a man at least twenty years the
      senior of his visitor&mdash;a handsome man of his kind, dark, deliberate
      of his movements, bred in the courtesies, but seemingly, to the acuter
      intuitions of Montaiglon, possessed of one unpardonable weakness in a
      gentleman&mdash;a shame of his obvious penury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have permitted myself, M. le Baron, to interrupt you on the counsel of
      a common friend,&rdquo; said Count Victor, anxious to put an end to a situation
      somewhat droll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the goblet, after the goblet,&rdquo; said Lamond softly, himself but
      sipping at the rim of his glass. &ldquo;It is the custom of the country&mdash;one
      of the few that's like to be left to us before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>À la santé de la bonne cause!</i>&rdquo; said the Count politely, choking
      upon the fiery liquor and putting down the glass with an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come from France&mdash;from Saint Germains,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may have
      heard of my uncle; I am the Count de Montaiglon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron betrayed a moment's confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell me, now?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Then you are the more welcome. I wish I
      could say so in your own language&mdash;that is, so far as ease goes,
      known to me only in letters. From Saint Germains&mdash;&rdquo; making a step or
      two up and down the room, with a shrewd glance upon his visitor in the
      bygoing. &ldquo;H'm, I've been there on a short turn myself; there are several
      of the Highland gentry about the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one Bethune&mdash;Hugh Bethune of Ballimeanach, Baron,&rdquo; replied
      Count Victor meaningly. &ldquo;Knowing that I was coming to this part of the
      world, and that a person of my tongue and politics might be awkwardly
      circumstanced in the province of Argyll, he took the liberty to give me
      your direction as one in whose fidelity I might repose myself. I came
      across the sleeve to Albion and skirted your noisy eastern coast with but
      one name of a friend, <i>pardieu</i>, to make the strange cliffs
      cheerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said the Baron simply, with half a bow. &ldquo;And Hugh
      Bethune, now&mdash;well, well! I am proud that he should mind of his old
      friend in the tame Highlands. Good Hugh!&rdquo;&mdash;a strange wistfulness came
      to the Baron's utterance&mdash;&ldquo;Good Hugh! he'll wear tartan when he has
      the notion, I'm supposing, though, after all, he was no Gael, or a very
      far-out one, for all that he was in the Marischal's tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen him in the tartan, beyond perhaps a waistcoat of it at
      a <i>bal masque.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? And yet he was a man generally full of Highland spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps his only weakness that nowadays he carries it with less
      dignity than he used to do. A good deal too much of the Highland spirit,
      M. le Baron, wears hoops, and comes into France in Leith frigates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, man!&rdquo; said the Baron, heedless of the irony, &ldquo;and Hugh wears the
      tartan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in the waistcoat,&rdquo; repeated Count Victor, complacently looking at
      his own scallops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even that!&rdquo; said the Baron, with the odd wistfulness in his voice. And
      then he added hurriedly, &ldquo;Not that the tartan's anything wonderful. It
      cost the people of this country a bonny penny one way or another. There's
      nothing honest men will take to more readily than the breeks, says I&mdash;the
      douce, honest breeks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless it be the petticoats,&rdquo; murmured the Count, smiling, and his
      fingers went to the pointing of his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like the breeks. The philabeg was aye telling your parentage in
      every line, so that you could not go over the moor to Lennox there but any
      drover by the roadside kent you for a small clan or a family of caterans.
      Some people will be grumbling that the old dress should be proscribed, but
      what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tartan is forbidden?&rdquo; guessed Count Victor, somewhat puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom flushed; a curious gleam came into his eyes. He turned to fumble
      noisily with the glasses as he replaced them in the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that was widely enough known,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Put down by the law,
      and perhaps a good business too. <i>Diaouil!</i>&rdquo; He came back to the
      table with this muttered objurgation, sat and stared into the grey film of
      the peat-fire. &ldquo;There was a story in every line,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a history in
      every check, and we are odd creatures in the glens, Count, that we could
      never see the rags without minding what they told. Now the tartan's in the
      dye-pot, and you'll see about here but <i>crotal</i>-colour&mdash;the old
      stuff stained with lichen from the rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what damage!&rdquo; said Count Victor with sympathetic tone. &ldquo;But there are
      some who wear it yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron started slightly. &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; he questioned, without taking his eyes
      from the embers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The precipitancy of my demands upon your gate and your hospitality must
      have something of an air of impertinence,&rdquo; said Count Victor briskly,
      unbuckling his sword and laying it before him on the table; &ldquo;but the cause
      of it lay with several zealous gentlemen, who were apparently not affected
      by any law against tartan, for tartan they wore, and <i>sans culottes</i>
      too, though the dirt of them made it difficult to be certain of either
      fact. In the East it is customary, I believe, for the infidel to take off
      his boots when he intrudes on sacred ground; nothing is said about
      stockings, but I had to divest myself of both boots and stockings. I waded
      into Doom a few minutes ago, for all the world like an oyster-man with my
      bag on my back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried the Baron. &ldquo;I forgot the tide. Could you not have
      whistled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whole operas, my dear M. le Baron, but the audience behind me would have
      made the performance so necessarily allegretto as to be ineffective. It
      was wade at once or pipe and perish. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> but I believe you
      are right; as an honest man I cannot approve of my first introduction to
      your tartan among its own mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been one of the corps of watches; it must have been some of
      the king's soldiers,&rdquo; suggested the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I think I know a red-coat when I see
      one,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;These were quite unlicensed hawks, with the hawk's call
      for signal too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; cried the Baron, standing up, and still with an
      unbelieving tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear M. le Baron, I killed one of the birds to look at the feathers.
      That is the confounded thing too! So unceremonious a manner of introducing
      myself to a country where I desire me above all to be circumspect; is it
      not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he revealed the agitation that his flippant words had tried to
      cloak&mdash;by a scarcely perceptible tremour of the hand that drummed the
      table, a harder note in his voice, and the biting of his moustache. He saw
      that Doom guessed his perturbation, and he compelled himself to a careless
      laugh, got lazily to his feet, twisted his moustache points, drew forth
      his rapier with a flourish, and somewhat theatrically saluted and lunged
      in space as if the action gave his tension ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron for a moment forgot the importance of what he had been told as
      he watched the graceful beauty of the movement that revealed not only some
      eccentricity but personal vanity of a harmless kind and wholesome tastes
      and talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I'm a little in the dark,&rdquo; he said when the point dropped and Count
      Victor recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; said his guest. &ldquo;I am vexed at what you may perhaps look on as a
      trifle. The ruffians attacked me a mile or two farther up the coast, shot
      my horse below me, and chased me to the very edge of your moat. I made a
      feint to shoot one with my pistol, and came closer on the gold than I had
      intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Macfarlanes!&rdquo; cried Doom, with every sign of uneasiness. &ldquo;It's a
      pity, it's a pity; not that a man more or less of that crew makes any
      difference, but the affair might call for more attention to this place and
      your presence here than might be altogether wholesome for you or me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the story in more detail, and when Count Victor had finished, ran
      into an adjoining room to survey the coast from a window there. He came
      back with a less troubled vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least they're gone now,&rdquo; said he in a voice that still had some
      perplexity. &ldquo;I wish I knew who it was you struck. Would it be Black Andy
      of Arroquhar now? If it's Andy, the gang will be crying 'Loch Sloy!' about
      the house in a couple of nights; if it was a common man of the tribe,
      there might be no more about it, for we're too close on the Duke's gallows
      to be meddled with noisily; that's the first advantage I ever found in my
      neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a man of a long habit of body,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;and he fell
      with a grunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was not Andy. Andy is like a hogshead&mdash;a blob of creesh with
      a turnip on the top&mdash;and he would fall with a curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name of a pipe! I know him; he debated the last few yards of the way with
      me, and I gave him De Chenier's mace in the jaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put him slightly out of countenance with the butt and trigger-guard of
      my pistol. Again I must apologise, dear Baron, for so unceremonious and
      ill-tempered an approach to your hospitality. You will confess it is a
      sort of country the foibles of whose people one has to grow accustomed to,
      and Bethune gave me no guidance for such an emergency as banditti on the
      fringe of Argyll's notoriously humdrum Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; repeated Doom. &ldquo;Will you step this way?&rdquo; He led Count Victor to the
      window that commanded the coast, and their heads together filled the
      narrow space as they looked out. It was a wondrous afternoon. The sun
      swung low in a majestic sky, whose clouds of gold and purple seemed to the
      gaze of Montaiglon a continuation of the actual hills of wood and heather
      whereof they were, the culmination. He saw, it seemed to him, the myriad
      peaks, the vast cavernous mountain clefts of a magic land, the abode of
      seraphim and the sun's eternal smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God is good!&rdquo; said he again, no way reverently, but with some emotion. &ldquo;I
      thought I had left for ever the place of hope, and here's Paradise with
      open doors.&rdquo; Then he looked upon the nearer country, upon the wooded
      hills, the strenuous shoulders of the bens upholding all that glory of
      sinking sunshine, and on one he saw upstanding, a vulgar blotch upon the
      landscape, a gaunt long spar with an overhanging arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said airily, &ldquo;there is civilisation in the land after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of law at least,&rdquo; said the Baron. &ldquo;Law of its kind&mdash;MacCailen
      law. His Grace, till the other day, as it might be, was Justice-General of
      the shire, Sheriff of the same, Regality Lord, with rights of pit and
      gallows. My place goes up to the knowe beside his gallows; but his Grace's
      regality comes beyond this, and what does he do but put up his dule-tree
      there that I may see it from my window and mind the fact. It's a fine
      country this; man, I love it! I'm bound to be loving it, as the saying
      goes, waking and sleeping, and it brought me back from France, that I had
      no illwill to, and kept me indoors in the 'Forty-five,' though my heart
      was in the rising, as Be-thune would tell you. A grand country out and in,
      wet and dry, winter and summer, and only that tree there and what it meant
      to mar the look and comfort of it. But here I'm at my sentiments and you
      starving, I am sure, for something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved from the window out of which he had been gazing with a fondness
      that surprised and amused his visitor, and called loudly for Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the little retainer was at the door jauntily saluting in his
      military manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hae ye been foraging the day, Mungo?&rdquo; asked the master indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na, there was nae need wi' a commissariat weel provided for
      voluntary. Auld Dugald brought in his twa kain hens yesterday; ane's on
      the bank and the cauld corp o' the ither o' them's in the pantry. There's
      the end o' a hench o' venison frae Strathlachlan, and twa oors syne, when
      the tide was oot, there was beef padovies and stoved how-to wdies, but I
      gied them to twa gaun-aboot bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both looked inquiringly at Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret the what-do-you-call-it?&mdash;the stoved howtowdy,&rdquo; said he,
      laughing, &ldquo;more for the sound of it than for any sense its name conveys to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's meat as weel as music in it, as the fox said when he ate the
      bagpipes,&rdquo; said Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's waur nor howtowdy. And oh! I forgot the het victual, there's
      jugged hare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the hare ready?&rdquo; asked the Baron suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no jist a'thegether what ye micht ca' ready,&rdquo; answered Mungo without
      hesitation; &ldquo;but it can be here het in nae time, and micht agree wi' the
      Count better nor the cauld fowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Annapla to do the best she can,&rdquo; broke in the Baron on his servant's
      cheerful garrulity; and Mungo with another salute disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do your women-folk like the seclusion of Doom?&rdquo; asked Count Victor,
      to make conversation while the refection was in preparation. &ldquo;With the sea
      about you so, and the gang of my marauding obese friend in the wood
      behind, I should think you had little difficulty in keeping them under
      your eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was obviously confused. &ldquo;Mungo's quite enough to keep his eye on
      Annapla,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He has the heart and fancy to command a garrison;
      there's a drum forever beating in his head, a whistle aye fifing in his
      lug, and he will amuse you with his conceits of soldiering ancient and
      modern, a trade he thinks the more of because Heaven made him so unfit to
      become 'prentice to it. Good Mungo! There have been worse men; indeed what
      need I grudge admitting there have been few better? He has seen this place
      more bien than it is to-day in my father's time, and in my own too before
      the law-pleas ate us up; you will excuse his Scots freedom of speech,
      Count, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shot rang outside in some shrubbery upon the mainland, suddenly putting
      an end to Doom's conversation. Count Victor, sure that the Macfarlanes
      were there again, ran to the window and looked out, while his host in the
      rear bit his lip with every sign of annoyance. As Montaiglon looked he saw
      Mungo emerge from the shrubbery with a rabbit in his hand and push off
      hurriedly in a little boat, which apparently was in use for communication
      with the shore under such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Count, without comment upon what he had seen, &ldquo;I
      think, with your kind permission, I shall change my boots before eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's plenty of time for that, I jalouse,&rdquo; said Doom, smiling somewhat
      guiltily, and he showed his guest to a room in the turret. It was up a
      flight of corkscrew stairs, and lit with singular poverty by an orifice
      more of the nature of a porthole for a piece than a window, and this port
      or window, well out in the angle of the turret, commanded a view of the
      southward wall or curtain of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon, left to himself, opened the bag that Mungo had placed in
      readiness for him in what was evidently the guest-room of the castle,
      transformed the travelling half of himself into something that was more in
      conformity with the gay nature of his upper costume, complacently surveyed
      the result when finished, and hummed a <i>chanson</i> of Pierre
      Gringoire's, altogether unremembering the encounter in the wood, the dead
      robber, and the stern nature of his embassy here so far from France.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent to close the valise, and with a start abruptly concluded his song
      at the sight of a miniature with the portrait of a woman looking at him
      from the bottom of the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mort de ma vie!</i> what a fool I am; what a forgetful <i>vengeur</i>,
      to be chanting Gringoire in the house of Doom and my quarry still to
      hunt!&rdquo; His voice had of a sudden gained a sterner accent; the pleasantness
      of his aspect became clouded by a frown. Looking round the constricted
      room, and realising how like a prison-cell it was compared with what he
      had expected, he felt oppressed as with the want of air. He sought vainly
      about the window for latch or hinge to open it, and as he did so glanced
      along the castle wall painted yellow by the declining sun. He noticed idly
      that some one was putting out upon the sill of a window on a lower stage
      what might have been a green kerchief had not the richness of its fabric
      and design suggested more a pennon or banneret. It was carefully placed by
      a woman's hands&mdash;the woman herself unseen. The incident recalled an
      old exploit of his own in Marney, and a flood of humorous memories of
      amorous intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Annapla,&rdquo; said he whimsically, &ldquo;has a lover, and here's his
      signal. The Baron's daughter? The Baron's niece? The Baron's ward? Or
      merely the Baron's domestic? M. Bethune's document suffers infernally from
      the fault of being too curt. He might at least have indicated the fair
      recluse.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV &mdash; WANTED, A SPY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wail of a mountain pipe, poorly played, as any one accustomed to its
      strains would have admitted, even if the instrument was one he loved, and
      altogether execrable in the ears of Montaiglon, called him to the <i>salle</i>,
      where Doom joined him in a meal whereof good Mungo's jugged hare formed no
      part. Mungo, who had upheld ancient ceremony by his crude performance on
      the <i>piob mhor</i>, was the attendant upon the table,&mdash;an office he
      undertook with his bonnet on his head, &ldquo;in token,&rdquo; as his master
      whisperingty explained to Count Victor, &ldquo;of his sometimes ill-informed
      purpose of conducting every formal task in Doom upon the strict letter of
      military codes as pertained in camps, garrisons, and strongholds.&rdquo; It was
      amusing to witness the poor fellow's pompous precision of movement as he
      stood behind his master's chair or helped the guest to his humble meal;
      the rigidity of his inactive moments, or the ridiculous jerkiness with
      which he passed a platter as 'twere to the time of a drill-sergeant's
      baton. More amusing still to one able, like Count Victor, to enter into
      the humour of the experience, was it to have his garrulity get the better
      of him in spite of the military punctilio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron was telling me aboot your exploit wi' the Loch Sloy pairty.
      Man! did I no' think ye had come by boat,&rdquo; he whispered over a tendered
      ale-glass. &ldquo;It was jist my luck to miss sic a grand ploy. I wad hae backed
      ye to haud the water against Black Andy and all his clan, and they're no'
      slack at a tulzie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye may be grand in a fight, Mungo, but only a middling man at forage,&rdquo;
       interrupted his master. &ldquo;I think ye said jugged hare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasna my faut,&rdquo; explained the domestic, &ldquo;that ye havena what was
      steepulated; the Baron wadna bide till the beast was cooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom laughed. &ldquo;Come, come, Mungo,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Count could scarcely be
      expected to wait for the cooking of an animal running wild in the bracken
      twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it disna tak' sae terrible lang to cook a hare,&rdquo; said the unabashed
      retainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was it a hare after a', Mungo?&rdquo; asked his master. &ldquo;Are ye sure it
      wasna a rabbit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rabbit!&rdquo; cried he in astonishment; then more cautiously, &ldquo;Weel, if it
      was a rabbit, it was a gey big ane, that's a' I can say,&rdquo; and he covered
      his perturbation by a retreat from the room to resume his office of
      musician, which, it appeared, demanded a tune after dinner as well as
      before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had seemed to Montaiglon a harsh, discordant torturing of reeds when
      heard on the stair outside his chamber, seemed somehow more mellowed and
      appropriate&mdash;pleasing even&mdash;when it came from the garden outside
      the castle, on whose grass-grown walk the little lowlander strutted as he
      played the evening melody of the house of Doom&mdash;a pibroch all imbued
      with passion and with melancholy. This distance lulled it into something
      more than human music, into a harmony with the monotone of the wave that
      thundered against the rock; it seemed the voice of choiring mermen; it had
      the bitterness, the agonised remembrance, of the sea's profound; it was
      full of hints of stormy nights and old wars. For a little Doom and his
      visitor sat silent listening to it, the former, with a strain upon his
      countenance, tapping nervously with his fingers upon the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old custom in the Highlands,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I set, perhaps, too
      little store by it myself, but Mungo likes to maintain it, though he plays
      the pipe but indifferently, and at this distance you might think the
      performance not altogether without merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love all music,&rdquo; replied Count Victor with polite ambiguity, and he
      marvelled at the signs of some deep feeling in his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till a late hour they sat together while Count Victor explained his
      mission to the Highlands. He told much, but, to be sure, he did not at
      first tell all. He recounted the evidences of the spy's guilt as a
      correspondent with the British Government, whose pay he drew while sharing
      the poor fortunes and the secrets of the exiled Jacobites. &ldquo;Iscariot, my
      dear Baron,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;was a Bayard compared with this wretch. His
      presence in your locality should pollute the air; have you not felt a
      malaise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's dooms hard,&rdquo; admitted the Baron, throwing up distressed hands, &ldquo;but,
      man, I'm feared he's not the only one. Do you know, I could mention
      well-kent names far ben in the Cause&mdash;men not of hereabouts at all,
      but of Lochaber no less, though you may perhaps not guess all that means&mdash;and
      they're in Paris up to the elbow now in the same trade. It's well known to
      some of yourselves, or should be, and it puzzles me that you should come
      to the shire of Argyll on account of one, as I take it, no worse than
      three or four you might have found by stepping across the road to Roisin's
      coffee-house in the Rue Vaugirard. The commoners in the late troubles have
      been leal enough, I'll give them that credit, but some of the gentry wag
      their tongues for Prince Tearlach and ply their pens for Geordie's pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant came in with two candles, placed them on the table, and
      renewed the fire. He had on a great woollen night-cowl of gaudy hue with a
      superb tassel that bobbed grotesquely over his beady eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll awa' to my bed, if it's your will, Baron,&rdquo; said he with the
      customary salute. &ldquo;I was thinkin' it might be needful for me to bide up a
      while later in case ony o' the Coont's freends cam' the way; but the
      tide'll keep them aff till mornin' anyway, and I'm sure we'll meet them a'
      the baulder then if we hae a guid sleep.&rdquo; He got permission to retire, and
      passed into the inky darkness of the corridor, and crept to that part of
      the vacant dwelling in which he had his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be another reason for my coming here,&rdquo; said Montaiglon,
      resuming the conversation where Mungo's entrance had broken it off. &ldquo;In
      this affair there was a lady. I knew her once.&rdquo; He paused with a manner
      showing discomposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there was liking; I can comprehend,&rdquo; said Doom with sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liking is but love without wings,&rdquo; said Montaiglon. &ldquo;My regard soared
      above the clay; I loved her, and I think she was not indifferent to me
      till this man came in her way. He had, they say, the devil's tongue; at
      least he had the devil's heart, and she died six months ago with her head
      on my arm. I could tell you the story, M. le Baron, but it is in all the
      books, and you can fancy it easily. She died forgiving her betrayer, and
      sending a message to that effect by me. I come to deliver it, and, by God!
      to push it to his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a dangerous errand in this country and at this time,&rdquo; said Doom,
      looking into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but you did not know Cecile,&rdquo; replied Montaiglon, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know the human heart. I know it in any man under the sober age of
      thirty. Better to let it rest thus. Excuse my interference. It does not
      matter much to me that it should be out of my house you should go seeking
      for your vengeance, but I'm an older man than you, and have learned how
      quickly the worst misfortunes and wrongs may be forgotten. In your place I
      would leave this man to the punishment of his own conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon laughed bitterly. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is to assume a mechanism
      that in his case never existed. Pardon me, I pray you, but I prefer the
      old reckoning, which will be all the fairer because he has the reputation
      of being a good swordsman, and I am not without some practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man's name? you have not mentioned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there you puzzle me. He was eight months in France, six of these in a
      lodging beside the Baigneurs on the Estrapade, Rue Dauphine. He came with
      no credentials but from Glengarry, and now Glengarry can give no account
      of him except that he had spoken familiarly to him of common friends in
      the Highlands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Glengarry&mdash;Alasdair Rhuadh!&rdquo; exclaimed the Baron, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And presumed to be burdened with a dangerous name, he passed with the
      name of Drimdarroch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drimdarroch!&rdquo; repeated the Baron with some apparent astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen the man, so far as I know, for I was at Cammercy when
      he hung about the lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drimdarroch!&rdquo; repeated Doom reflectively, &ldquo;a mere land title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And some words he dropped in the ear of the lady made me fancy he might
      be found about the Court of Argyll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drimdarroch! Drimdarroch! I ken no one of the name, though the name
      itself, for very good reasons, is well known to me. Have you any
      description of the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. A man older than myself, dark, well-bred. I should say a man
      something like yourself, if you will pardon the comparison, with a less
      easy mind, if he remembers his friends and his past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom pushed back his chair a little from the fire, but without taking his
      eyes from the peats, and made a curious suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not take it to be me, would you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor laughed, with a gesture of his hands that made denial all
      unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you do not know,&rdquo; went on the Baron. &ldquo;Some months of caballing
      with our friends&mdash;even our Hielan' friends&mdash;in the France, left
      me with an unwholesome heart that would almost doubt my father in his
      grave. You mentioned the name Drimdarroch&mdash;is it not the odd thing
      that you should speak it to the only man in the shire that ever had the
      right to use it? Do you see this?&rdquo; and rising he stepped to a recess in
      the wall, only half curtained, so that its contents overflowed into the
      chamber, and by a jerk of the hand revealed a strange accumulation of
      dusty documents in paper and in parchment. He looked at them with an
      aspect of disgust, and stirred them with a contemptuous toe as if he
      meddled with the litter of a stye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Drimdarroch!&rdquo; said he, intensely bitter; &ldquo;that's Drimdarroch, and
      Duntorvil, that's the Isles, the bonny Isles of Lochow; that's damn like
      to be Doom too! That and this ruckle of stones we sit in are all that's
      left of what was my father's and my grandfather's and their forebears back
      till the dark of time. And how is it, ye may ask? Let us pretermit the
      question till another occasion; anyway here's Drimdarroch wi' the lave, at
      any rate the weight of it in processes, records, caveats, multiple
      poindings, actions of suspension and declator, interim decrees, fugie
      warrants, compts, and reckonings&mdash;God! I have the cackle of the law
      in my head like a ballant, and what's the wonder at that wi' all my
      practice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and picked up from the confused heap of legal scrivenings by
      finger-tips that seemed to fear infection a parchment fouled with its
      passage through the courts and law offices. &ldquo;You're in luck indeed,&rdquo; said
      he; &ldquo;for there's Drimdarroch&mdash;all that's left of it to me: the land
      itself is in the hands of my own doer, Petullo the writer down-by, and
      scab seize his bestial!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back he threw the relic of his patrimony; he dropped the curtain; he
      turned on his guest a face that tried to smile. &ldquo;Come, let us sit down
      again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and never heed my havers. Am I not thankful to have Doom
      itself left me, and the company of the hills and sea? After all, there are
      more Drimdarrochs than one in the Highlands, for the name means just 'the
      place at the back of the oak-wood or the oaken shaw,' and oaks are as
      plentiful hereabout as the lawyers are in the burgh down-by. I but
      mentioned it to show you the delicacy of your search, for you do not know
      but what I'm the very man you want, though I'm sitting here looking as if
      acting trusty for the Hanoverian cause did not fill my pouches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tenez!</i> M. Bethune was scarcely like to send me to Doom in that
      case,&rdquo; said the Count laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Bethune, like yourself, may never have seen the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes, it is true, he did not see him any more than I did. Drimdarroch,
      by all accounts, was a spendthrift, a player, a <i>bavard</i>, his great
      friends, Glengarry and another Scot, Balhaldie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Balhaldie! blethering Balhaldie!&rdquo; cried Doom, contempt upon his
      countenance. &ldquo;And Balhaldie would sell him, I'll warrant. He seems, this
      Drimdarroch, to have been dooms unlucky in his friends. I say all I've
      said to you, Count, because you're bound to find it out for yourself some
      day if you prosecute your search here, and you might be coming round to me
      at last with your ower-ready pistol when I was ill-prepared to argue out
      my identity. Furthermore, I do not know the man you want. About the castle
      down-by his Grace has a corps of all kinds that you might pick from nine
      times out of ten without striking an honest man. Some of them are cadets
      of his own family, always blunt opponents of mine and of our cause here
      and elsewhere; some are incomers, as we call them; a few of them from
      clans apparently friendly to us when in other quarters, but traitors and
      renegades at the heart; some are spies by habit and repute. There's not a
      friend of mine among them, not in all the fat and prosperous rabble of
      them; but I wish you were here on another errand, though to Doom, my poor
      place, you are welcome. I am a widower, a lonely man, with my own flesh
      and blood rebel against me&rdquo;&mdash;he checked his untimeous confidence&mdash;&ldquo;and
      yet I have been chastened by years and some unco experiences from a
      truculent man to one preferring peace except at the last ditch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh bien!</i> Monsieur; <i>this</i> is the last ditch!&rdquo; said
      Montaiglon. &ldquo;Spy and murderer, M. le Baron, and remember I propose to give
      him more than the murderer's chance when I agree to meet him on a fair
      field with a sword in his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen you lunge, sir,&rdquo; said Doom meaningly; &ldquo;I ken the carriage of
      a fencer's head; your eye's fast, your step's light; with the sword I take
      it Drimdarroch is condemned, and your practice with the pistol, judging
      from the affair with the Macfarlanes, seems pretty enough. You propose, or
      I'm mistaken, to make yourself the executioner. It is a step for great
      deliberation, and for the sake of a wanton woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried Montaiglon, half rising in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom's eyes gleamed, a quiver ran over his brow, and a furrow came to the
      jaw; his hand went to his side, where in other days there might have been
      a dagger. It was the flash of a moment, and died again almost before
      Montaiglon had seen and understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mille pardons!</i>&rdquo; said Doom with uncouth French. &ldquo;I used the word in
      its most innocent sense, with its kindliest meaning; but I was a fool to
      use it at all, and I withdraw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor bowed his head. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Perhaps I am too much
      Quixote, for I saw her but a few times, and that briefly. She was like a&mdash;like
      a fine air once heard, not all to be remembered, never wholly to be
      forgot. She had a failing, perhaps&mdash;the error of undue affection to
      qualify her for a sinful world. As it was, she seemed among other women
      some rarity out of place&mdash;Venus at a lantern feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ye would send this man to hell that he may find his punishment in
      remembering her? If I thought so much of vengeance I would leave him on
      the earth forgetting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Baron, I make you my compliments of your complacence,&rdquo; said Count
      Victor, rising to his feet and desirous to end the discussion. &ldquo;I am only
      Victor de Montaiglon, poorly educated in the forgiveness of treachery, and
      lamentably incapable of the nobihty <i>de cour</i> that you profess. But I
      can be grateful; and if you give me the hospitality of your house for a
      day or two, I shall take care that neither it nor its owner will be
      implicated in my little affair. Touching retirement &ldquo;&mdash;he went on
      with a smile&mdash;&ldquo;I regret exceedingly an overpowering weariness. I have
      travelled since long before dawn, and burning the candle <i>par les deux
      bouts</i> is not, as Master Mungo hints, conducive to a vigorous reception
      of the Macfarlanes if they feel like retaliating to-morrow, and making
      your domicile the victim of my impetuosity and poor marksmanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom sighed, took up a candle, and led the way into the passage. A chill
      air was in the corridor, that smelled like a cellar underground, and as
      their footsteps sounded reverberant upon the flags uncar-peted, Doom
      Castle gave the stranger the impression of a vault. Fantastic shadows
      danced macabre in the light of the candles; they were the only furniture
      of that part of the rough dwelling that the owner shuffled through as
      quickly as he could to save his guest from spying too closely the
      barrenness of the land. He went first to the outer door with the candle
      before he said good night, drew back great bars, and opened the oak. The
      sky was studded with pale golden stars; the open air was dense with the
      perfume of the wood, the saline indication of the sea-ware. On the rocky
      edge of the islet at one part showed the white fringe of the waves now
      more peaceful; to the north brooded enormous hills, seen dimly by the
      stars, couchant terrors, vague, vast shapes of dolours and alarms. Doom
      stood long looking at them with the flame of the candle blowing inward and
      held above his head&mdash;a mysterious man beyond Montaiglon's
      comprehension. He stood behind him a pace or two, shivering in the evening
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be seeing little there, I'll warrant, Count, but a cold night and
      inhospitable vacancy, hard hills and the robber haunting them. For me,
      that prospect is my evening prayer. I cannot go to sleep without it, for
      fear I wake in Paradise and find it's all by with Doom and the native
      hills for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And by that he seemed to Montaiglon more explicable: it was the lover he
      was; the sentimentalist, the poet, knowing the ancient secret of the
      animate earth, taking his hills and valleys passionately to his heart. The
      Frenchman bowed his sympathy and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a wonder Mungo kept his word and went to bed,&rdquo; said the Baron,
      recovering his ordinary manner, &ldquo;for it would just suit his whim to bide
      up and act sentry here, very well pleased at the chance your coming gave
      him of play-acting the man of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bolted the door again with its great bars, then gravely preceded his
      guest to the foot of the turret stair, where he handed him the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're in a dreary airt of the house,&rdquo; he said apologetically, &ldquo;but I
      hope you may find it not uncomfortable. Doom is more than two-thirds but
      empty shell, and the bats have the old chapel above you. <i>Oidhche mhath!</i>
      Good night!&rdquo; He turned upon his heel and was gone into the farther end of
      the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Montaiglon went up to his room, the guttering candle flame, puffed at
      by hidden and mischievous enemies from broken ports and gun-slits, showed
      upon the landing lower than his own a long corridor he had not observed
      upon his first ascent. With the candle held high above his head he glanced
      into the passage, that seemed to have several doors on either hand. In a
      castle so sparsely occupied the very knowledge of this long and empty
      corridor in the neighbourhood of his sleeping apartment conferred a sense
      of chill and mystery. He thought he could perceive the odour of damp,
      decayed wood, crumbled lime, hanging rotten in stagnant airs and covered
      with the dust of years. &ldquo;<i>Dieu!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed involuntarily, &ldquo;this
      is no Cammercy.&rdquo; He longed for some relief from the air of mystery and
      dread that hung about the place. A laugh would have been a revelation, a
      strain of song a miracle of healing. And all at once he reflected upon the
      Annapla as yet unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These might be her quarters,&rdquo; he reflected, finding a solace in the
      thought. The chill was at once less apparent, a pleasant glow of
      companionship came over him. Higher up he held the light to see the
      farther into the long passage, and as he did so the flame was puffed out.
      It seemed so human a caprice that he drew himself sharply against the
      wall, ready by instinct to evade any rush or thrust that was to follow.
      And then he smiled at his own alarm at a trick of the wind through some of
      La-mond's ill-patched walls, and found his consolation in the sense of
      companionship confirmed by sight of a thin line of light below a door
      mid-way up the curious passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annapla, for a louis!&rdquo; he thought cheerfully. &ldquo;Thank heaven for one
      petticoat in Doom&mdash;though that, in truth, is to concede the lady but
      a scanty wardrobe.&rdquo; And he hummed softly as he entered his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied exceedingly by the toils of the day, he had no sooner thrown
      himself upon the bed than he slept with no need for the lullaby aid of the
      sea that rumoured light and soothingly round the rock of Doom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V &mdash; THE FLAGEOLET
    </h2>
    <p>
      He woke from a dream of pressing danger and impotent flight to marvel
      where he was in darkness; fancied himself at first in some wayside inn
      mid-way over Scotland, and sat up suddenly with an exclamation of
      assurance that he was awake to the suppositious landlord who had called,
      for the sense of some sound but stilled on the second of his waking was
      strong within him. He fastened upon the vague starlit space of the little
      window to give him a clew to his situation. Then he remembered Doom, and,
      with the window for his key, built up the puzzle of his room, wondering at
      the cause of his alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had risen and sent a loud murmur through the trees along the
      coast; the sea, in breakers again, beat on the rock till Doom throbbed.
      But there was nothing in that to waken a man who had ridden two days on
      coarse roads and encountered and fought with banditti. Decidedly there was
      some menace in the night; danger on hard fields had given him blood alert
      and unsleeping; the alarum was drumming at his breast. Stealthily he put
      out his hand, and it fell as by a fiddler's instinct upon the spot desired&mdash;the
      hilt of his sword. There he kept it with his breath subdued, and the
      alarum severely quelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      An owl's call sounded on the shore, extremely pensive in its note, and
      natural, but unusual in the rhythm of its repetition. It might have passed
      for the veritable call of the woods to an unsuspicious ear, but Montaiglon
      knew it for a human signal. As if to prove it so, it was followed by the
      grating of the outer door upon its hinge, and the sound of a foot
      stumbling among stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected that the tide was out in all probability, and at once the
      notion followed that here were his searchers, the Macfarlanes, back in
      force to revenge his impetuous injury to their comrades. But then&mdash;a
      second thought almost as promptly told him in that case there should be no
      door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound of subdued voices came from the foot of the tower and died in the
      garden behind or was swept elsewhere by the wind; then, through the voice
      of the wave, the moan of the wind, and its whistle in vent and cranny,
      came a strain of music&mdash;not the harsh uncultured pipe of Mungo the
      servitor, but a more dulcet air of flute or flageolet. In those dark
      savage surroundings it seemed a sound inhuman, something unreal, something
      of remembrance in delirium or dream, charged for this Parisian with a
      thousand recollections of fond times, gay times, passionate times
      elsewhere. Doom throbbed to the waves, but the flageolet stirred in him
      not so much surprise at this incongruous experience as a wave of emotion
      where all his past of gaillard was crystalled in a second&mdash;many
      nights of dance and song anew experienced in a mellow note or two; an old
      love reincarnated in a phrase (and the woman in the dust); the evenings of
      Provence lived again, and Louis's darling flute piping from the chateau
      over the field and river; moons of harvest vocal with some peasant cheer;
      in the south the nightingale searching to express his kinship with the
      mind of man and the creatures of the copse, his rapture at the star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the elusive nature of the music gave it more than half its magic.
      It would die away as the wind declined, or come in passionate crescendo.
      For long it seemed to Montaiglon&mdash;and yet it was too short&mdash;the
      night was rich with these incongruous but delightful strains. Now the
      player breathed some soft, slow, melancholy measure of the manner Count
      Victor had often heard the Scottish exiles croon with tears at his
      father's house, or sing with too much boisterousness at the dinners of the
      St. Andrew's Club, for which the Leith frigates had made special provision
      of the Scottish wine. Anon the fingers strayed upon an Italian symphony
      full of languors and of sun, and once at least a dance gave quickness to
      the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more haunting than all was one simple strain and brief, indeed never
      wholly accomplished, as if the player sought to recollect a song forgot,
      that was repeated over and over again, as though it were the motive of the
      others or refrain. Sometimes Montaiglon thought the player had despaired
      of concluding this bewitching melody when he changed suddenly to another,
      and he had a very sorrow at his loss; again, when its progress to him was
      checked by a veering current of the wind and the flageolet rose once more
      with a different tune upon it, he dreaded that the conclusion had been
      found in the lacuna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose at last and went to the window, and tried in the wan illumination
      of the heavens to detect the mysterious musician in the garden, but that
      was quite impossible: too dark the night, too huge and profound the
      shadows over Doom. He went to his door and opened it and looked down the
      yawning stairway; only the sigh of the wind in the gun-slits occupied the
      stairway, and the dark was the dark of Genesis. And so again to bed, to
      lie with his weariness for long forgotten. He found that tantalising
      fragment return again and again, but fated never to be complete. It
      seemed, he fancied, something like a symbol of a life&mdash;with all the
      qualities there, the sweetness, the affection, the passion, the divine
      despair, the longing, even the valours and the faiths to make a great
      accomplishment, but yet lacking the round accomplishment. And as he waited
      once again for its recurrence he fell asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI &mdash; MUNGO BOYD
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was difficult for Count Victor, when he went abroad in the morning, to
      revive in memory the dreary and mysterious impressions of his arrival; and
      the melody he had heard so often half-completed in the dark waste and
      hollow of the night was completely gone from his recollection, leaving him
      only the annoying sense of something on the tongue's-tip, as we say, but
      as unattainable as if it had never been heard. As he walked upon a little
      knoll that lay between the seaside of the castle and the wave itself, he
      found an air of the utmost benignity charged with the odours of wet autumn
      woodlands in a sunshine. And the sea stretched serene; the mists that had
      gathered in the night about the hills were rising like the smoke of calm
      hearths into a sky without a cloud. The castle itself, for all its natural
      arrogance and menace, had something pleasant in its aspect looked at from
      this small eminence, where the garden did not display its dishevelment and
      even the bedraggled bower seen from the rear had a look of trim'
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to the morning's cheerfulness Mungo was afoot whistling a ballad
      air of the low country, with a regard for neither time nor tune in his
      puckered lips as he sat on a firkin-head at an outhouse door and gutted
      some fish he had caught with his own hands in a trammel net at the
      river-mouth before Montaiglon was awake and the bird, as the Gaelic goes,
      had drunk the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gude mornin' to your honour,&rdquo; he cried with an elaborately flourished
      salute as Montaiglon sauntered up to him. &ldquo;Ye're early on the move,
      Monsher; a fine caller mornin'. I hope ye sleepit weel; it was a gowsty
      nicht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his assumed indifference and the purely casual nature of his
      comment upon the night, there was a good deal of cunning, thought
      Montaiglon, in the beady eyes of him, but the stranger only smiled at the
      ease of those Scots domestic manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did very well, I thank you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My riding and all the rest of it
      yesterday would have made me sleep soundly inside the drum of a marching
      régiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's richt, that's richt,&rdquo; said Mungo, ostentatiously handling the fish
      with the awkward repugnance of one unaccustomed to a task so menial, to
      prove perhaps that cleansing them was none of his accustomed office.
      &ldquo;That's richt. When we were campaignin' wi' Marlborough oor lads had many
      a time to sleep wi' the cannon dirlin' aboot them. Ye get us'd to't, ye
      get us'd to't, as Annapla says aboot bein' a weedow woman. And if ye hae
      noticed it, Coont, there's nae people mair adapted for fechtin' under
      diffeeculties than oor ain; that's what maks the Scots the finest sogers
      in the warld. It's the build o' them, 'Lowlan' or 'Hielan', the breed o'
      them; the dour hard character o' their country and their mainner o'
      leevin'. We gied the English a fleg at the 'Forty-five,' didnae we? That
      was where the tartan cam' in: man, there's naethin' like us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not speak like a Highlander,&rdquo; said Montaiglon, finding some of
      this gasconade unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm no' exactly a'thegether a Hielan'man,&rdquo; Mungo admitted, &ldquo;though I
      hae freends con-nekit wi' the auldest clans, and though I'm, in a mainner
      o' speakin', i' the tail o' Doom, as I was i' the tail o' his faither
      afore him&mdash;peace wi' him, he was the grand soger!&mdash;but Hielan'
      or Lowland, we gied them their scuds at the 'Forty-five.' Scots regiments,
      sir, a' the warld ower, hae had the best o't for fechtin', marchin', or
      glory. See them at the auld grand wars o' Sweden wi' Gus-tavus, was there
      ever the like o' them? Or in your ain country, whaure's the bate o' the
      Gairde Ecossay, as they ca't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with such a zest, he seemed to fire with such a martial glow,
      that Montaiglon began to fancy that this amusing grotesque, who in stature
      came no higher than his waist, might have seen some service as sutler or
      groom in a campaigning regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, with his surprise restrained from the most
      delicate considerations for the little man's feelings; &ldquo;have you been in
      the wars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was manifestly a home-thrust to Mungo. He had risen, in his moment of
      braggadocio, and was standing over the fish with a horn-hilted
      gutting-knife in his hands, that were sanguine with his occupation, and he
      had, in the excess of his feeling, made a flourish of the knife, as if it
      were a dagger, when Montaiglon's query checked him. He was a bubble burst,
      his backbone&mdash;that braced him to the tension of a cuirassier of
      guards&mdash;melted into air, into thin air, and a ludicrous limpness came
      on him, while his eye fell, and confusion showed about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the wars!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Weel&mdash;no jist a'thegether what ye micht
      call i' the wars&mdash;though in a mainner o' speakin', gey near't. I had
      an uncle oot wi' Balmerina; ye may hae heard tell o'm, a man o' tremendous
      valour, as was generally al-ooed&mdash;Dugald Boyd, by my faither's side.
      There's been naethin' but sogers in oor family since the be-ginnin' o'
      time, and mony ane o' them's deid and dusty in foreign lands. It it hadnae
      been for the want o' a half inch or thereby in the height o' my heels &ldquo;&mdash;here
      he stood upon his toes&mdash;&ldquo;I wad hae been in the airmy mysel'. It's the
      only employ for a man o' spunk, and there's spunk in Mungo Boyd, mind I'm
      tellin' ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the most obvious thing in the world, good Mungo,&rdquo; said Montaiglon,
      smiling. &ldquo;You eviscerate fish with the gusto of a gladiator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then an odd thing happened to relieve Mungo's embarrassment and end
      incontinent his garrulity. Floating on the air round the bulge of the
      turret came a strain of song in a woman's voice, not powerful, but rich
      and sweet, young in its accent, the words inaudible but the air startling
      to Count Victor, who heard no more than half a bar before he had realised
      that it was the unfinished melody of the nocturnal flageolet. Before he
      could comment upon so unexpected and surprising a phenomenon, Mungo had
      dropped his gutting-knife and made with suspicious rapidity for the
      entrance of the castle, without a word of explanation or leave-taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I become decidedly interested in Annapla,&rdquo; said Montaiglon to himself,
      witnessing this odd retreat, &ldquo;and my host gives me no opportunity of
      paying my homages. Malediction! It cannot be a wife; Bethune said nothing
      of a wife, and then M. le Baron spoke of himself as a widower. A domestic,
      doubtless; that will more naturally account for the ancient fishmonger's
      fleet retirement. He goes to chide the erring Abigail. Or&mdash;or&mdash;or
      the cunning wretch!&rdquo; continued Montaiglon with new meaning in his eyes,
      &ldquo;he is perhaps the essential lover. Let the Baron at breakfast elucidate
      the mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Baron at breakfast said never a word of the domestic economy of
      his fortalice. As they sat over a frugal meal of oat porridge, the poached
      fish, and a smoky, high-flavoured mutton ham, whose history the Count was
      happy not to know, his host's conversation was either upon Paris, where he
      had spent some months of sad expatriation, yawning at its gaiety (it
      seemed) and longing for the woods of Doom; or upon the plan of the search
      for the spy and double traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon's plans were simple to crudeness. He had, though he did not say
      so, anticipated some assistance from Doom in identifying the object of his
      search; but now that this was out of the question, he meant, it appeared,
      to seek the earliest and most plausible excuse for removal into the
      immediate vicinity of Argyll's castle, and on some pretext to make the
      acquaintance of as many of the people there as he could, then to select
      his man from among them, and push his affair to a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plausible scheme,&rdquo; said Doom when he heard it, &ldquo;but contrived without
      any knowledge of the situation. It's not Doom, M. le Count&mdash;-oh no,
      it's not Doom down by there; it's a far more kittle place to learn the
      outs and ins of. The army and the law are about it, the one about as
      numerous as the other, and if your Drimdarroch, as I take it, is a traitor
      on either hand&mdash;to Duke Archie as well as to the king across the
      water, taking the money of both as has happened before now, he'll be no
      Drimdarroch you may wager, and not kent as such down there. Indeed, how
      could he? for Petullo the writer body is the only Drimdarroch there is to
      the fore, and he has a grieve in the place. Do you think this by-named
      Drimdarroch will be going about cocking his bonnet over his French amours
      and his treasons? Have you any notion that he will be the more or the less
      likely to do so when he learns that there's a French gentleman of your
      make in the country-side, and a friend of Doom's, too, which means a
      Jacobite? A daft errand, if I may say it; seeking a needle in a haystack
      was bairn's play compared to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you sit down on the haystack you speedily find the needle, M. le
      Baron,&rdquo; said Montaiglon playfully. &ldquo;In other words, trust my sensibility
      to feel the prick of his presence whenever I get into his society. The
      fact that he may suspect my object here will make him prick all the
      quicker and all the harder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even yet you don't comprehend Argyll's court. It's not Doom, mind you,
      but a place hotching with folk&mdash;half a hundred perhaps of whom have
      travelled as this Drimdarroch has travelled, and in Paris too, and just of
      his visage perhaps. Unless you challenged them all seriatim, as Petullo
      would say, I see no great prospect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could coax the fly here! That or something like it was what I
      half expected to be able to do when Bethune gave me your address as that
      of a landlord in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom reddened, perhaps with shame at the altered condition of his state in
      the house of his fathers. &ldquo;I've seen the day,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;I've seen
      the day they were throng enough buzzing about Doom, but that was only so
      long as honey was to rob with a fair face and a nice humming at the
      robbery. Now that I'm a rooked bird and Doom a herried nest, they never
      look the road I'm on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo, standing behind his master's chair, gave a little crackling laugh
      and checked it suddenly at the angry flare in his master's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're mighty joco!&rdquo; said the Baron; &ldquo;perhaps you'll take my friend and
      me into your confidence;&rdquo; and he frowned with more than one meaning at the
      little-abashed retainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paurdon! paurdon!&rdquo; said Mungo, every part of the chart-like face thrilled
      with some uncontrollable sense of drollery, and he exploded in laughter
      more violent than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; cried his master in the accent of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domestic drew himself swiftly to attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;you're a damned fool! In the army ye would have
      got the triangle for a good deal less. Right about face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo saluted and made the required retreat with a great deal less than
      his usual formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a bit crack in the creature after all,&rdquo; said the Baron,
      displaying embarrassment and annoyance, and he quickly changed the
      conversation, but with a wandering mind, as Count Victor could not fail to
      notice. The little man, to tell the truth, had somehow laughed at the
      wrong moment for Count Victor's peace of mind. For why should he be amused
      at the paucity of the visitors from Argyll's court to the residence of
      Doom? Across the table at a man unable to conceal his confusion Montaiglon
      stole an occasional glance with suspicion growing on him irresistibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inscrutable face was there, as many Highland faces were to him, even
      among old friends in France, where Balhaldie, with the best possible hand
      at a game of cards, kept better than any gambler he had ever known before
      a mask of dull and hopeless resignation. The tongue was soft and
      fair-spoken, the hand seemed generous enough, but this by all accounts had
      been so even with Drimdarroch himself, and Drimdarroch was rotten to the
      core.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very curious,&rdquo; thought Montaiglon, making poor play with his braxy ham.
      &ldquo;Could Bethune be mistaken in this extraordinary Baron?&rdquo; And he patched
      together in his mind Mungo's laughter with the Baron's history as briefly
      known to him, and the inexplicable signal and alarm of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Mademoiselle Annapla seems to be an entrancing vocalist,&rdquo; said he
      airily, feeling his way to a revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron, in his abstraction, scarcely half comprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just the maid!&rdquo; and never a word more, but into a
      new topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust so,&rdquo; thought the Count; &ldquo;but the fair songster who signals from
      her window and has clandestine meetings at midnight with masculine voices
      must expect some incredulity on that point. Can it be possible that here I
      have Bluebeard or Lothario? The laughter of the woman seems to indicate
      that if here is not Lothario, here at all events is something more than
      seems upon the surface. <i>Tonnerre de dieu!</i> I become suspicious of
      the whole breed of mountaineers. And not a word about last night's alarm&mdash;that
      surely, in common courtesy, demands some explanation to the guest whose
      sleep is marred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out together upon the mainland in the forenoon to make inquiries
      as to the encounter with the Macfarlanes, of whose presence not a sign
      remained. They had gone as they had come, without the knowledge of the
      little community on the south of Doom, and the very place among the
      bracken where the Count had dropped his bird revealed no feather; the rain
      of the morning had obliterated every other trace. He stood upon the very
      spot whence he had fired at the luckless robber, and restored, with the
      same thrill of apprehension, the sense of mystery and of dread that had
      hung round him as he stole the day before through voiceless woods to the
      sound of noisy breakers on a foreign shore. He saw again the brake nod in
      a little air of wind as if a form was harboured, and the pagan rose in him&mdash;not
      the sceptic but the child of nature, early and remote, lost in lands of
      silence and of omen in dim-peopled and fantastic woods upon the verge of
      clamorous seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said he with a shiver, turning to his host. &ldquo;This is
      decidedly not Verrays in the Rue Conde. I would give a couple of louis
      d'or for a moment of the bustle of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sad place yon!&rdquo; said Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And back they went to the castle to play a solemn game of lansquenet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII &mdash; THE BAY OF THE BOAR'S HEAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      A solemn game indeed, for the Baron was a man of a sobriety unaccountable
      to Montaiglon, who, from what he knew of Macdonnel of Barisdel, Mac-leod,
      Balhaldie, and the others of the Gaelic gang in Paris, had looked for a
      roysterer in Doom. It was a man with strange melancholies he found there,
      with a ludicrous decorum for a person of his condition, rising regularly
      on the hour, it seemed, and retiring early to his chamber like a peasant,
      keeping no company with the neighbouring lairds because he could not even
      pretend to emulate their state, passing his days among a score of books in
      English, some (as the Sieur de Guille) in French, and a Bedel Bible in the
      Irish letter, and as often walking aimlessly about the shore looking
      ardently at the hills, and rehearsing to himself native rhymes that ever
      account native women the dearest and the same hills the most beautiful in
      God's creation. He was the last man to look to for aid in an enterprise
      like Montaiglon's: if he had an interest in the exploit it seemed it was
      only to discourage the same, and an hour or two of his company taught the
      Count he must hunt his spy unaided.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hunting of the spy, in the odd irrelevance or inconsistency of
      nature, was that day at least an enterprise altogether absent from his
      thoughts. He had been diverted from the object of his journey to Scotland
      by just such a hint at romance as never failed to fascinate a Montaiglon,
      and he must be puzzling himself about the dulcet singer and her share in
      the clandestine midnight meeting. When he had finished his game with his
      host, and the latter had pleaded business in the burgh as an excuse for
      his absence in the afternoon, Count Victor went round Doom on every side
      trying to read its mystery. While it was a house whose very mortar must be
      drenched with tradition, whose every window had looked upon histories
      innumerable worth retelling, nothing was revealed of the matter in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many rooms of it were obviously unoccupied, for in the domestic routine of
      the Baron and of Mungo and the lady of song there were two storeys utterly
      unoccupied, and even in the flats habited there were seemingly chambers
      vacant, at least ever unopened and forlorn. Count Victor realised, as he
      looked at the frowning and taciturn walls, that he might be in Doom a
      twelvemonth and have no chance to learn from that abstracted scholar, its
      owner, one-half of its interior economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the ground he could get no clear view of the woman's window: that he
      discovered early, for it was in the woman he sought the key to all Doom's
      little mystery. He must, to command the window, climb to his own chamber
      in the tower, and even then it was not a full front view he had, but a
      foreshortened glance at the side of it and the signal, if any more
      signalling there might be. He never entered that room without a glance
      along the sun-lit walls; he never passed the mouth of that corridor on the
      half landing where his candle had blown out without as curious a scrutiny
      as good-breeding might permit. And nothing was disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo pervaded the place&mdash;Mungo toiling in the outhouses at tasks the
      most menial, feeding the half-dozen moulting poultry, digging potatoes in
      the patch of garden or plucking colewort there, climbing the stairs with
      backets of peat or wood, shaking a table-cloth to the breeze; and in the
      <i>salle</i> the dark and ruminating master indulging his melancholy by
      rebuilding the past in the red ash of the fire, or looking with pensive
      satisfaction from his window upon the coast, a book upon his knee&mdash;that
      was Doom as Count Victor was permitted to know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began at last to doubt his senses, and half believe that what he had
      heard on the night of his arrival had been some chimera, a dream of a
      wearied and imperilled man in unaccustomed surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo saw him walk with poorly concealed curiosity about the outside of
      the stronghold, and smiled to himself as one who knows the reason for a
      gentleman's prying. Montaiglon caught that smile once: his chagrin at its
      irony was blended with a pleasing delusion that the frank and genial
      domestic might proffer a solution without indelicate questioning. But he
      was soon undeceived: the discreet retainer knew but three things in this
      world&mdash;the grandeur of war, the ancient splendour of the house of
      Doom, and the excellent art of absent-mindedness. When it came to the
      contents of Doom, Mungo Boyd was an oyster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been a place of some importance in its day,&rdquo; said Count
      Victor, gazing up at the towering walls and the broken embrasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is't yet?&rdquo; demanded Mungo, jealously, with no recollection that
      a moment ago he had been mourning its decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh bien!</i> It is quite charming, such of it as I have had the honour
      to see; still, when the upper stages were habitable&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and Count Victor mentally cursed his luck that he must fence with a
      blunt-witted scullion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ay! I'll alio' I've seen it no' sae empty, if that's what ye mean;
      but if it's no' jist Dumbarton or Dunedin, it's still auld bauld Doom, and
      an ill deevil to crack, as the laddie said that found the nutmeg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; conceded Montaiglon, &ldquo;and yet, and yet&mdash;have you ever
      heard of Jericho, M. Boyd? Its capitulation was due to so simple a thing
      as the playing of a trumpet or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ken naething aboot trumpets,&rdquo; said Mungo curtly, distinguishing some <i>arrière
      pensée</i> in the interrogator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fi donc!</i> and you so much the old <i>sabreur!</i> Perhaps your
      people marched to the flageolet&mdash;a seductive instrument, I assure
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man betrayed confusion. &ldquo;Annapla thrieps there's a ghaistly
      flageolet aboot Doom,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it'll hae to toil away lang or the
      wa's o' oor Jericho fa',&mdash;they're seeven feet thick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He plays divinely, this ghostly flageoleteer, and knows his Handel to a
      demi-semi-quaver,&rdquo; said Count Victor coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord! lugs! I told them that!&rdquo; muttered Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naething; we're a' idiots noo and then, and&mdash;and I maun awa' in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So incontinently he parted from Count Victor, who, to pass the afternoon,
      went walking on the mainland highway. He walked to the south through the
      little hamlet he and Doom had visited earlier in the day; and as the
      beauty of the scenery allured him increasingly the farther he went, he
      found himself at last on a horn of the great bay where the Duke's seat lay
      sheltered below its hilly ramparts. As he had walked to this place he had
      noticed that where yesterday had been an empty sea was now a fleet of
      fishing-boats scurrying in a breeze off land, setting out upon their
      evening travail&mdash;a heartening spectacle; and that on either side of
      him&mdash;once the squalid huts of Doom were behind&mdash;was a more
      dainty country with cultivated fields well-fenced, and so he was not
      wholly unprepared for the noble view revealed when he turned the point of
      land that hid the policies of MacCailen Mor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet the sight somewhat stunned. In all his notions of Drimdarroch's
      habitation, since he had seen the poverty of Doom, he had taken his idea
      from the baron's faded splendour, and had ludicrously underestimated the
      importance of Argyll's court and the difficulty of finding his man.
      Instead of a bleak bare country-side, with the ducal seat a mean tower in
      the midst of it, he saw a wide expanse of thickly-wooded and inhabitable
      country speckled for miles with comfortable dwellings, the castle itself a
      high embattled structure, clustered round by a town of some dimensions,
      and at its foot a harbour, where masts were numerous and smoke rose up in
      clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was, plainly, a different society from Doom; here was something of
      what the exiled chiefs had bragged of in their cups. The Baron had
      suggested no more than a dozen of cadets about the place. <i>Grand Dieu!</i>
      there must be a regiment in and about this haughty palace, with its black
      and yellow banner streaming in the wind, and to seek Drimdarroch there and
      round that busy neighbourhood seemed a task quite hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      For long he stood on the nose of land, gazing with a thousand speculations
      at where probably lay his prey; and when he returned to the castle of Doom
      it looked all the more savage and inhospitable in contrast with the lordly
      domicile he had seen. What befell him there on his return was so odd and
      unexpected that it clean swept his mind again of every interest in the
      spy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII &mdash; AN APPARITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tide in his absence had come in around the rock of Doom, and he must
      signal for Mungo's ferry. Long and loud he piped, but there was at first
      no answer; and when at last the little servitor appeared, it was to look
      who called, and then run back with a haste no way restrained by any sense
      of garrison punctilio. He was not long gone, but when he came down again
      to the boat his preparations for crossing took up an unconscionable time.
      First the boat must be baled, it seemed, and then a thole-pin was to find;
      when launched the craft must tangle her bow unaccountably and awkwardly in
      the weeds. And a curt man was Mungo, though his salute for Count Victor
      had lost none of its formality. He seemed to be the family's friend
      resenting, as far as politeness might, some inconvenience to which it was
      being subjected without having the power to prevent the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had gained the rock, dusk was on the country, brought the
      sooner for a frost-fog that had been falling all afternoon. It wrapped the
      woods upon the shore, made dim the yeasty waterway, and gave Doom itself
      the look of a phantom edifice. It would be ill to find a place less
      hospitable and cheerful in its outer aspect; not for domestic peace it
      seemed, but for dark exploits. The gloomy silhouette against the drab sky
      rose inconceivably tall, a flat plane like a cardboard castle giving
      little of an impression of actuality, but as a picture dimly seen,
      flooding an impressionable mind like Count Victor's with a myriad
      sensations, tragic and unaccustomed. From the shore side no light
      illumined the sombre masonry; but to the south there was a glow in what he
      fancied now must be the woman's window, and higher up, doubtless in the
      chapel above the flat he occupied himself, there was a radiance on which
      Mungo at the oars turned round now and then to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whistling a careless melody, and with no particularly acute observation of
      anything beyond the woman's window, which now monopolised his keenest
      interest in Doom, Count Victor leaped out of the boat as soon as it
      reached the rock, and entered the castle by the door which Mungo had left
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had been a crêpe-like fog outside was utter gloom within. The
      corridor was pitch-black, the stair, as he climbed to his room, was like a
      wolf's throat, as the saying goes; but as he felt his way up, a door
      somewhere above him suddenly opened and shut, lending for a moment a gleam
      of reflected light to his progress. It was followed immediately by a
      hurried step coming down the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he thought he was at length to see the mysterious Annapla, but
      the masculine nature of the footfall told him he was in error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Baron,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;and home before me by another route,&rdquo; and he
      stepped closely into the right side of the wall to give passage. But the
      darkness made identity impossible, and he waited the recognition of
      himself. It never came. He was brushed past as by a somnambulist, without
      greeting or question, though to accomplish it the other in the narrow
      stairway had to rub clothes with him. Something utterly unexpected in the
      apparition smote him with surprise and apprehension. It was as if he had
      encountered something groping in a mausoleum&mdash;something startling to
      the superstitious instinct, though not terrific in a material way. When it
      passed he stood speechless on the stair, looking down into the profound
      black, troubled with amazement, full of speculation. All the suspicions
      that he had felt last night, when the signal-calls rose below the turret
      and the door had opened and the flageolet had disturbed his slumbers, came
      back to him more sinister, more compelling than before. He listened to the
      declining footfall of that silent mystery; a whisper floated upwards, a
      door creaked, no more than that, and yet the effect was wildly disturbing,
      even to a person of the <i>sang froid</i> of Montaiglon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a bound he went up to his chamber and lit a candle, and stood a space
      on the floor, lost in thought. When he looked at his face, half
      unconscious that he did so, in a little mirror on a table, he saw revealed
      there no coward terrors, but assuredly alarm. He smiled at his pallid
      image, tugged in Gascon manner at his moustache, and threw out his chest;
      then his sense of humour came to him, and he laughed at the folly of his
      perturbation. But he did not keep the mood long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My <i>sans culottes</i> surely do not share the hospitality of Doom with
      me in its owner's absence,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;And yet, and yet&mdash;! I owe
      Bethune something for the thrill of the experiences he has introduced me
      to. Now I comprehend the affection of those weeping exiles for the very
      plain and commonplace life of France they profess to think so indifferent
      a country compared with this they have left behind. A week of these ghosts
      would drive me to despair. To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;M. de
      Montaiglon&mdash;to-morrow you make your reluctant adieux to Doom and its
      inexplicable owner, whose surprise and innuendo are altogether too
      exciting for your good health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he promised himself as he walked up and down the floor of his chamber,
      feeling himself in a cage, yet unable to think how he was to better his
      condition without the aid of the host whose mysteries disturbed so much by
      the suspicions they aroused. Bethune had told him Lamond, in spite of his
      politics and his comparative poverty, was on neighbourly terms with
      Argyll, and would thus be in a position to put him in touch with the
      castle of the Duke and the retinue there without creating any suspicion as
      to the nature of his mission. It was that he had depended on, and to no
      other quarter could he turn with a hope of being put into communication
      with the person he sought. But Doom was apparently quite unqualified to be
      an aid to him. He was, it seemed, at variance with his Grace on account of
      one of those interminable lawsuits with which the Gaelic chiefs, debarred
      from fighting in the wholesome old manner with the sword, indulged their
      contestful passions, and he presented first of all a difficulty that Count
      Victor in his most hopeless moments had never allowed for&mdash;he did not
      know the identity of the man sought for, and he questioned if it could
      easily be established. All these considerations determined Count Victor
      upon an immediate removal from this starven castle and this suspicious
      host. But when he joined Doom in the <i>salle</i> he constrained his
      features to a calm reserve, showing none of his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the Baron seated by the fire, and ready to take a suspiciously
      loud but abstracted interest in his ramble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye've seen the castle of the King o' the
      Hielan's, as we call him, have you? And what think ye of MacCailen's
      quarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon lounged to a chair, threw a careless glance at his
      interrogator, pulled the ever upright moustache, and calmly confessed them
      charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bitter smile came on the face of his host. &ldquo;They might well be that,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;There's many a picking there.&rdquo; And then he became garrulous upon
      the tale of his house and family, that seemed to have been dogged by
      misfortune for a century and a half; that had owned once many of these
      lush glens, the shoulders of these steep bens, the shores of that curving
      coast. Bit by bit that ancient patrimony had sloughed off in successive
      generations, lost to lust, to the gambler's folly, the spendthrift's
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard, is it not?&rdquo; questioned his host. &ldquo;I'm the man that should have Doom
      at its very best, for I could bide among my people here, and like them,
      and make them like me, without a thought of rambling about the world.
      'Mildewing with a ditch between you and life' my grandfather used to call
      it, when old age took him back from his gaieties abroad. Faith! I wish I
      had the chance to do it better than I may. All's here I ever wanted of
      life, and I have tasted it elsewhere, too. Give me my own acres and my own
      people about me, and it would be a short day indeed from the rise of the
      sun till bedtime&mdash;a short day and a happy. My father used, after a
      week or two at home, to walk round the point of Strome where you were
      to-day and look at the skiffs and gabberts in the port down-by, and the
      sight never failed to put frolic in the blood of him. If he saw a light
      out there at sea&mdash;the lamp of a ship outbound&mdash;he would stand
      for hours in his night-sark at the window gloating on it. As for me, no
      ship-light gave me half the satisfaction of the evening star coming up
      above the hill Ardno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Montaiglon&mdash;&ldquo;to-morrow is another day; that's my
      consolation in every trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At something on the happy side of thirty it may be that,&rdquo; admitted Doom;
      &ldquo;at forty-five there's not so muckle satisfaction in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all this Count Victor, in spite of the sympathy that sometimes
      swept him away into his host's narrative, felt his doubts come back and
      back at intervals. With an eye intent upon the marvel before him, he asked
      often what this gentleman was concealing. Was he plotting something? And
      with whom? What was the secret of that wind-blown castle, its unseen
      occupants, its midnight music, the ironic laughter of the domestic Mungo,
      the annoyance of its master at his mirth? Could he possibly be unaware of
      the strange happenings in his house, of what signalled by day and crept on
      stairs at night? To look at him yearning there, he was the last man in the
      world to associate with the thrilling moment of an hour ago when
      Montaiglon met the marvel on the stairway; but recollections of
      Drimdarroch's treachery, and the admission of Doom himself that it was not
      uncommon among the chiefs, made him hopeless of reading that inscrutable
      face, and he turned to look about the room for some clue to what he found
      nowhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chamber plain to meanness&mdash;there seemed nothing here to help him to
      a solution. The few antlered stag-heads upon the walls were mangey and
      dusty; the strip of arras that swayed softly in the draught of a window
      only sufficed to accentuate the sordid nature of that once pretentious
      interior. And the half-curtained recess, with the soiled and dog-eared
      documents of the law, was the evidence of how all this tragedy of a
      downfallen house had come about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom's eyes saw his fall upon the squalid pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that's the ashes of Doom, all that's left of what we
      burned in fiery living and hot law-pleas. We have the ash and the others
      have warm hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor, who had been warming his chilled fingers at the fire, moved
      to the curtain and drew it back, the better again to see that doleful
      cinerary urn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His host rose hurriedly from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trash! trash! Only trash, and dear bought at that,&rdquo; said he, seeing his
      guest's boot-toe push the papers in with a dainty man's fastidiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the deed was done before the implied protest was attended. The Count's
      movements revealed a Highland dagger concealed beneath one of the
      parchments! It was a discovery of no importance in a Highland castle,
      where, in spite of the proscription of weapons, there might innocently be
      something so common as a dagger left; but a half-checked cry from the
      Baron stirred up again all Count Victor's worst suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Doom, and saw his face was hot with some confusion, and that
      his tongue stammered upon an excuse his wits were not alert enough to
      make.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and picked up the weapon&mdash;an elegant instrument well
      adorned with silver on the hilt and sheath; caught it at the point, and,
      leaning the hilt upon his left wrist in the manner of the courtier
      slightly exaggerated, and true to the delicacies of the <i>salle-d'armes</i>,
      proffered it to the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom laughed in some confusion. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, lamely, &ldquo;Mungo's been at
      his dusting again,&rdquo; and he tried to restore the easiness of the
      conversation that the incident had so strangely marred.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Montaiglon could not so speedily restore his equanimity. For the
      unknown who had so unceremoniously brushed against him on the dark stair
      had been attired in tartan clothes. It had been a bare knee that had
      touched him on the leg; it had been a plaid-fringe that had brushed across
      his face; and his knuckles had been rapped lightly by the protuberances
      upon the sheath and hilt of a mountain dagger. M. le Baron's proscription
      of arms seemed to have some strange exceptions, he told himself. They were
      not only treated with contempt by the Macfarlanes, but even in Doom
      Castle, whose owner affected to look upon the garb of his ancestors as
      something well got rid of. For the life of him, Count Victor could not
      disassociate the thought of that mysterious figure on the stair, full clad
      in all Highland panoply against the law, and the men&mdash;the broken men&mdash;who
      had shot his pony in the wood and attempted to rob him. All the
      eccentricities of his host mustered before him&mdash;his narrow state here
      with but one servant apparent, a mysterious room tenanted by an invisible
      woman, and his coldness&mdash;surely far from the Highland temper&mdash;to
      the Count's scheme of revenge upon the fictitious Drimdarroch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awkward pause even the diplomacy of the Frenchman could not
      render less uncomfortable, and the Baron fumbled with the weapon ere he
      laid it down again on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Count Victor, now with his mind made up, &ldquo;I see no
      prospect of pushing my discoveries from here, and it is also unfair that I
      should involve you in my adventure, that had much better be conducted from
      the plain base of an inn, if such there happens to be in the town down
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of unmistakable relief, quelled as soon as it breathed across his
      face, came to the Baron. &ldquo;Your will is my pleasure,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;but
      there is at this moment no man in the world who could be more welcome to
      share my humble domicile.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I think I could work with more certainty of a quick success from a
      common lodging in the town than from here. I have heard that now and then
      French fish dealers and merchants sometimes come for barter to this coast
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ghost of a smile came over Doom's face. &ldquo;They could scarcely take you
      for a fish merchant, M. le Count,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events common fairness demands that I should adopt any means that
      will obviate getting your name into the thing, and I think I shall try the
      inn. Is there one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the best in all the West Country there,&rdquo; said Doom, &ldquo;kept by a
      gentleman of family and attainments. But it will not do for you to go down
      there without some introduction. I shall have to speak of your coming to
      some folk and see if it is a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh bien!</i> Remember at all events that I am in affairs,&rdquo; said
      Montaiglon, and the thing was settled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX &mdash; TRAPPED
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was only at the dawn, or the gloaming, or in night itself&mdash;and
      above all in the night&mdash;that the castle of Doom had its tragic
      aspect. In the sun of midday, as Count Victor convinced himself on the
      morrow of a night with no alarms, it could be almost cheerful, and from
      the garden there was sometimes something to be seen with interest of a
      human kind upon the highway on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solitary land, but in the happy hours people were passing to and fro
      between the entrances to the ducal seat and the north. Now and then bands
      of vagrants from the heights of Glencroe and the high Rest where Wade's
      road bent among the clouds would pass with little or no appeal to the
      hospitality of Doom, whose poverty they knew; now and then rustics in red
      hoods, their feet bare upon the gravel, made for the town market,
      sometimes singing as they went till their womanly voices, even in airs
      unfamiliar and a language strange and guttural, gave to Count Victor an
      echo of old mirth in another and a warmer land. Men passed on rough short
      ponies; once a chariot with a great caleche roof swung on the rutless
      road, once a company of red-coat soldiery shot like a gleam of glory
      across the afternoon, moving to the melody of a fife and drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the latter Mungo had a sour explanation. They were come, it seemed, to
      attend a trial for murder. A clansman of the Duke's and a far-out cousin
      (in the Highland manner of speaking) had been shot dead in the country of
      Appin; the suspected assassin, a Stewart of course, was on trial; the
      blood of families and factions was hot over the business, and the
      Government was sending its soldiery to convoy James Stewart of the Glen,
      after his conviction, back to the place of execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, <i>mon Dieu!</i> he is yet to try, is he not?&rdquo; cried Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ay!&rdquo; Mungo acquiesced, &ldquo;but that doesna' maitter; the puir cratur is
      as guid as scragged. The tow's aboot his thrapple and kittlin' him
      already, I'll warrant, for his name's Stewart, and in this place I would
      sooner be ca'd Beelzebub; I'd hae a better chance o' my life if I found
      mysel' in trouble wi' a Campbell jury to try me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon watched this little cavalcade of military march along the road,
      with longing in his heart for the brave and busy outside world they
      represented. He watched them wistfully till they had disappeared round the
      horn of land he had stood on yesterday, and their fife and drum had
      altogether died upon the air of the afternoon. And turning, he found the
      Baron of Doom silent at his elbow, looking under his hat-brim at the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More trouble for the fesse checkey, Baron,&rdquo; said he, indicating the point
      whereto the troops had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unluckiest blazon on a coat,&rdquo; replied the castellan of Doom; &ldquo;trouble
      seems to be the part of every one who wears it. It's in a very unwholesome
      quarter when it comes into the boar's den&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boar's den?&rdquo; repeated Montaiglon interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The head of the pig is his Grace's cognisance. Clan Diarmaid must have
      got it first by raiding in some Appin stye, as Petullo my doer down-by
      says. He is like most men of his trade, Petullo; he is ready to make his
      treasonable joke even against the people who pay him wages, and I know he
      gets the wages of the Duke as well as my fees. I'm going down to transact
      some of the weary old business with him just now, and I'll hint at your
      coming. A Bordeaux wine merchant&mdash;it will seem more like the thing
      than the fish dealer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know a good deal more about wine than about fish,&rdquo; laughed Count
      Victor, &ldquo;so it will be safer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you would be best to have been coming to the town when the
      Macfarlanes attacked you, killed your horse, and chased you into my place.
      That's the most plausible story we can tell, and it has the virtue of
      being true in every particular, without betraying that Bethune or
      friendship for myself was in any part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can leave it all to your astuteness,&rdquo; said Montaiglon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was absent, as he had suggested was possible, all day. The
      afternoon was spent by Count Victor in a dull enough fashion, for even
      Mungo seemed morose in his master's absence, perhaps overweighted by the
      mysteries now left to his charge, disinclined to talk of anything except
      the vast wars in which his ancestors had shone with blinding splendour,
      and of the world beyond the confines of Doom. But even his store of
      reminiscence became exhausted, and Count Victor was left to his own
      resources. Back again to his seat on the rock he went, and again to the
      survey of the mainland that seemed so strangely different a clime from
      this where nothing dwelt but secrecy and decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon the traffic on the highway had ceased, for the burgh now
      held all of that wide neighbourhood that had leisure, or any excuse of
      business to transact in the place where a great event was happening. The
      few that moved in the sun of the day were, with but one exception, bound
      for the streets; the exception naturally created some wonder on the part
      of Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was a man in the dress (to judge at a distance) of a gentleman, and
      his action was singular. He was riding a jet-black horse of larger stature
      than any that the rustics and farmers who had passed earlier in the day
      bestrode, and he stood for a time half-hidden among trees opposite the
      place where Count Victor reclined on a patch of grass among whin-bushes.
      Obviously he did not see Montaiglon, to judge from the calmness of his
      scrutiny, and assuredly it was not to the Frenchman that, after a little,
      he waved a hand. Count Victor turned suddenly and saw a responsive hand
      withdrawn from the window that had so far monopolised all his interest in
      Doom's exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annapla had decidedly an industrious wooer, more constant than the sun
      itself, for he seemed to shine in her heavens night and day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, in a sense, but little in the incident, which was open to a
      score of innocent or prosaic explanations, and the cavalier was spurring
      back a few minutes later to the south, but it confirmed Count Victor's
      determination to have done with Doom at the earliest, and off to where the
      happenings of the day were more lucid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper-time the Baron had not returned. Mungo came up to discover Count
      Victor dozing over a stupid English book and wakened him to tell him so,
      and that supper was on the table. He toyed with the food, having no
      appetite, turned to his book again, and fell asleep in his chair. Mungo
      again came in and removed the dishes silently, and looked curiously at him&mdash;so
      much the foreigner in that place, so perjink in his attire, so incongruous
      in his lace with this solitary keep of the mountains. It was a strange
      face the servant turned upon him there at the door as he retired to his
      kitchen quarters. And he was not gone long when he came back with a woman
      who walked tiptoe into the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the puir cratur,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;seekin' for whit he'll never find,
      like the man with the lantern playin' ki-hoi wi' honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked with interest at the stranger, said no word, but disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peats sunk upon the hearth, crumbling in hearts of fire: on the outer
      edges the ashes grew grey. The candles of coarse mould, stuck in a rude
      sconce upon the wall above the mantelshelf, guttered to their end, set
      aslant by wafts of errant wind that came in through the half-open door and
      crevices of the window. It grew cold, and Montaiglon shook himself into
      wakefulness. He sat up in his chair and looked about him with some sense
      of apprehension, with the undescribable instinct of a man who feels
      himself observed by eyes unseen, who has slept through an imminently
      dangerous moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a voice outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Baron,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Late, but still in time to say good-night to
      the guest he rather cavalierly treats.&rdquo; And he rose and went downstairs to
      meet his host. The great door was ajar. He went into the open air. The
      garden was utterly dark, for clouds obscured the stars, and the air was
      laden with the saline odour of the wrack below high-water mark. The tide
      was out. What he had expected was to see Mungo and his master, but behind
      the castle where they should have been there was no one, and the voices he
      heard had come from the side next the shore. He listened a little and took
      alarm, for it was not one voice but the voices of several people he heard,
      and in the muffled whispers of men upon some dishonest adventure. At once
      he recalled the Macfarlanes and the surmise of Baron Doom that in two
      nights they might be crying their slogan round the walls that harboured
      their enemy. He ran hastily back to the house, quickly resumed the sword
      that had proved little use to him before, took up the more businesslike
      pistol that had spoiled the features of the robber with the bladder-like
      head, and rushed downstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Qui est la?</i>&rdquo; he demanded as he passed round the end of the house
      and saw dimly on the rock a group of men who had crossed upon the ebb. His
      appearance was apparently unexpected, for he seemed to cause surprise and
      a momentary confusion. Then a voice cried &ldquo;Loch Sloy!&rdquo; and the company
      made a rush to bear him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew hastily behind the wall of the garden where he had them at
      advantage. As he faced round, the assailants, by common consent, left one
      man to do his business. He was a large, well-built man, so far as might be
      judged in the gloom of the night, and he was attired in Highland clothes.
      The first of his acts was to throw off a plaid that muffled his shoulders;
      then he snapped a futile pistol, and fell back upon his sword, with which
      he laid out lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dark it was impossible to make pretty fighting of the encounter.
      The Frenchman saw the odds too much against him, and realised the weakness
      of his flank; he lunged hurriedly through a poor guard of his opponent's,
      and pierced the fleshiness of the sword-arm. The man growled an oath, and
      Count Victor retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo, with a blanched face, was trembling in the entrance, and a woman
      was shrieking upstairs. The hall, lit by a flambeau that Mungo held in one
      hand, while the other held a huge horse-pistol, looked like the entrance
      to a dungeon,&mdash;something altogether sinister and ugly to the
      foreigner, who had the uneasy notion that he fought for his life in a
      prison. And the shrieks aloft rang wildly through the night like something
      in a story he had once read, with a mad woman incarcerated, and only to
      manifest herself when danger and mystery threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ye come! in ye come!&rdquo; cried the servant, trembling excessively till
      the flambeau shook in his hand and his teeth rattled together. &ldquo;In ye
      come, and I'll bar the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was time, indeed, to be in; for the enemy leaped at the oak as Count
      Victor threw it back upon its hinges, rather dubious of the bars that were
      to withstand the weight without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of them reassured, however: they were no light bars Mungo drew
      forth from their channels in the masonry, but huge black iron-bound blocks
      a foot thick that ran in no staples, but could themselves secure the
      ponderous portals against anything less than an assault with cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious that the gentry outside knew the nature of this
      obstruction, for, finding the bars out, they made no attempt to force the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, the Count and servant looked at each other's faces&mdash;the
      latter with astonishment and fear, the former with dumb questioning, and
      his ear to the stair whence came the woman's alarms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron tell't us there would be trouble,&rdquo; stammered the retainer,
      fumbling with the pistol so awkwardly that he endangered the body of his
      fellow in distress. &ldquo;Black Andy was never kent to forget an injury, and I
      aye feared that the low tides would bring him and his gang aboot the
      castle. Good God! do you hear them? It's a gey wanchancy thing this!&rdquo; he
      cried in terror, as the shout &ldquo;Loch Sloy!&rdquo; arose again outside, and the
      sound of voices was all about the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman within heard it too, for her cries became more hysterical than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n ye, ye skirlin' auld bitch!&rdquo; said the retainer, turning in
      exasperation, &ldquo;can ye no steeck your jaw, and let them dae the howlin'
      outside?&rdquo; But it was in a tone of more respect he shouted up the stair
      some words of assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was no abatement of the cries, and Montaiglon, less&mdash;to do
      him justice&mdash;to serve his curiosity as to Annapla than from a natural
      instinct to help a distressed woman, put a foot on the stair to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na! ye mauna leave me here!&rdquo; cried Mungo, plucking at his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something besides fear in the appeal, there was alarm of another
      sort that made Montaiglon pause and look the servitor in the eyes. He
      found confusion there as well as alarm at the furore outside and the
      imminent danger of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to God he was here himser,&rdquo; said Mungo helplessly, but still he
      did not relinquish his hold of Count Victor's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That need not prevent us comforting the lady,&rdquo; said Count Victor,
      releasing himself from the grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her alane, let her alane!&rdquo; cried the servant distractedly, following
      the Frenchman upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor paid no heed: he was now determined to unveil a mystery that
      for all he knew might menace himself in this household of strange midnight
      happenings. The cries of the woman came from the corridor he had guessed
      her chamber to occupy, and to this he hastened. But he had scarcely
      reached the corridor when the flambeau Mungo held was suddenly blown out,
      and this effectively checked his progress. He turned for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n that draught!&rdquo; said Mungo testily, &ldquo;it's blawn oot my licht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to do without it, then,&rdquo; said the Count, &ldquo;but you must show me
      the way to this shrieking woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A' richt,&rdquo; said Mungo, &ldquo;mind yer feet!&rdquo; He passed before the Count and
      cautiously led him up to the passage where the woman's cries, a little
      less vehement, were still to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ye are! and muckle gude may it dae ye,&rdquo; he said, stopping at a door
      and pushing it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor stepped into darkness, thrust lightly as he went by the
      servant's hand, and the door closed with a click behind him. He was a
      prisoner! He had the humour to laugh softly at the conventionality of the
      deception as he vainly felt in an empty room for a non-existing
      doorhandle, and realised that Mungo had had his own way after all. The
      servant's steps declined along the corridor and down the stair, with a
      woman's to keep them company and a woman's sobs, all of which convinced
      the Count that his acquaintance with Annapla was not desired by the
      residents of Doom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X &mdash; SIM MACTAGGART, CHAMBERLAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the roof of a high old church with as little architectural elegance as
      a dry-stone barn, a bell jerked by a rope from the church-yard indicated
      the close association of law and the kirk by ringing a sort of triumphal
      peal to the procession of the judges between the court-room and the inn.
      Contesting with its not too dulcet music blared forth the fanfare of two
      gorgeous trumpeters in scarlet and gold lace, tie wigs, silk stockings,
      and huge cocked hats, who filled the street with a brassy melody that
      suggested Gabriel's stern and awful judgment-summons rather than gave
      lightness and rhythm to the feet of those who made up the procession. The
      procession itself had some dreadful aspects and elements as well as others
      incongruous and comical. The humorous fancy might see something to smile
      at in the two grey-wigged bent old men in long scarlet coats who went in
      front of the trumpeters, prepared to clear the way if necessary (though a
      gust of shrewd wind would have blown them off their feet), by means of the
      long-poled halberts they carried; but this impression of the farcical was
      modified by the nature of the body whereof they were the pioneers or
      advance guard. Sleek magistrates and councillors in unaccustomed black
      suits and silver-buckled shoes, the provost ermined at their head, showed
      the way to the more actual, the more dignified embodiment of stern Scots
      law. At least a score of wigs were there from the Parliament House of
      Edinburgh, a score of dusty gowns, accustomed to sweep the lobbies of the
      Courts of Session, gathered the sand of the burgh street, and in their
      midst walked the representatives of that old feudal law at long-last
      ostensibly abandoned, and of the common law of the land. Argyll was in a
      demure equivalent for some Court costume, with a dark velvet coat, a
      ribbon of the Thistle upon his shoulder, a sword upon his haunch, and for
      all his sixty-six years he carried himself less like the lawyer made at
      Utrecht&mdash;like Justice-General and Extraordinary Lord of Session&mdash;than
      like the old soldier who had served with Marlborough and took the field
      for the House of Hanover in 1715. My Lords Elchies and Kilkerran walked on
      either side of him&mdash;Kilkerran with the lack-lustre eye of the
      passionate mathematician, the studious moralist devoted to midnight oil, a
      ruddy, tall, sturdy man, well filling the crimson and white silk gown;
      Elchies, a shrivelled atomy with a hirpling walk, leaning heavily upon a
      rattan, both with the sinister black tri-corne hats in their hands, and
      flanked by a company of musketeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great band of children lent the ludicrous element again to the company
      by following close upon its heels, chanting a doggerel song to the tune of
      the trumpets; the populace stood at the close-mouths or leaned over their
      windows looking at the spectacle, wondering at the pomp given to the
      punishment of a Stewart who a few years ago would have been sent to the
      gallows by his Grace with no more formality than might have attended the
      sentence of a kipper salmon-poacher to whipping at the hands of Long Davie
      the dempster.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Grace was entertaining the Lords, the Counsel (all but the convict's
      lawyers&mdash;a lot of disaffected Jacobites, who took their food by
      themselves at the inn, and brusquely refused his Grace's hospitality), the
      magistracy, and some county friends, to a late dinner at the castle that
      night, and an hour after saw them round the ducal board.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Count Victor was astonished at the squalid condition of things in the
      castle of the poor Baron of Doom, he would have been surprised to find
      here, within an hour or two's walk of it, so imposing and luxuriant a
      domesticity. Many lands, many hands, great wealth won by law, battle, and
      the shrewdness of generations, enabled Argyll to give his castle grandeur
      and his table the opulence of any southern palace. And it was a bright
      company that sat about his board, with several ladies in it, for his
      duchess loved to have her sojourn in her Highland home made gay by the
      company of young women who might by their beauty and light hearts recall
      her own lost youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bagpipe stilled in the hall, a lute breathed a melody from a
      neighbouring room, the servants in claret and yellow livery noiselessly
      served wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elchies sourly pursed his lips over his liquor, to the mingled amusement
      and vexation of his Grace, who knew his lordship's cellar, or even the
      Justiciary Vault in the town (for the first act of the Court had been to
      send down bins from Edinburgh for their use on circuit), contained no
      vintage half so good, and &ldquo;Your Grace made reference on the way up to some
      one killed in the neighbourhood,&rdquo; he said, as one resuming a topic begun
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not six miles from where we sit,&rdquo; replied the Duke, his cultivated
      English accent in a strong contrast with the broad burr of the Edinburgh
      justiciar, &ldquo;and scarcely a day before you drove past. The man shot, so far
      as we have yet learned, was a Macfarlane, one of a small but ancient and
      extremely dishonest clan whose country used to be near the head of Loch
      Lomond. Scarcely more than half a hundred of them survive, but they give
      us considerable trouble, for they survive at the cost of their neighbour's
      gear and cattle. They are robbers and footpads, and it looks as if the
      fatality to one of their number near Doom has been incurred during a raid.
      We still have our raids, Lord Elchies, in spite of what you were saying on
      the bench as to the good example this part of the country sets the rest of
      the Highlands&mdash;not the raids of old fashion, perhaps, but more
      prosaic, simply thefts indeed. That is why I have had these troops brought
      here. It is reported to me pretty circumstantially that some of the Appin
      people are in the key to attempt a rescue of James Stewart on his way to
      the place of execution at Lettermore. They would think nothing of
      attempting it once he was brought the length of Benderloch, if only a law
      officer or two had him in charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have thought the duty of keeping down a ploy of that kind would
      have been congenial to your own folk,&rdquo; said Elchies, drenching his
      nostrils vulgarly with macabaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argyll smiled. &ldquo;You may give us credit for willingness to take our share
      of the responsibility of keeping Appin in order,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I should not
      wonder if there are half a hundred claymores with hands in them somewhere
      about our old barracks in Maltland. Eh! Simon?&rdquo; and he smiled down the
      table to his Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five-and-forty, to be strict,&rdquo; said the gentleman appealed to, and never
      a word more but a sudden stop, for his half-eaten plum had miraculously
      gone from his plate in the moment he had looked up at the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was't in your lands?&rdquo; asked Elchies, indifferent, but willing to help on
      a good topic in a company where a variety of classes made the conversation
      anything but brisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Argyll, &ldquo;it was in Doom, the place of a small landowner,
      Lamond, whose castle&mdash;it is but a ramshackle old bigging now&mdash;you
      may have noticed on your left as you rode round. Lamond himself is a man I
      have a sort of softness for, though, to tell the truth, he has forced me
      into more litigation than he had money to pay for and I had patience to
      take any lasting interest in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron of Doom, is that the man?&rdquo; cried Elchies, dryly. &ldquo;Faith, I ken
      him well. Some years syne he was living months at a time in the Court of
      Session, and eating and sleeping in John's Coffee-house, and his tale&mdash;it's
      a gey old one&mdash;was that the litigation was always from the other
      side. I mind the man weel; Baron he called himself, though, if I mind
      right, his title had never been confirmed by the king <i>n liberam
      baroniam</i> He had no civil nor criminal jurisdiction. A black-avised
      man; the last time he came before me&mdash;Mr. Petullo, ye were there&mdash;it
      was in a long-standing case o' multiple poinding, and if I'm no'mistaken,
      a place ca'd Drimadry or Drimdarry, or something like that, changed hands
      ower the head o't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Petullo the writer, shrinking near the foot of the table in an adequate
      sense of his insignificance, almost choked himself by gulping the whole
      glass of wine at his lips in his confusion, and broke into a perspiration
      at the attention of the company thus drawn to him. He squeaked back an
      unintelligible acquiescence; and completed his own torture by upsetting a
      compote of fruit upon his black knee-breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the unhappy lawyer sat a lady of extraordinary beauty&mdash;a
      haughty, cold, supercilious sort of beauty, remarkable mainly from the
      consciousness of its display. Her profile might have been cut from marble
      by a Greek; her neck and bust were perfect, but her shoulders, more
      angular than was common in that time of bottle-shape, were carried
      somewhat too grandly for a gentle nature. The cruelty of her character
      betrayed itself in a faint irrestrainable smile at Petullo's discomfiture,
      all the more cruel because his eyes were entreatingly on hers as he mopped
      up awkwardly the consequences of his gaucherie. She smiled, but that was
      not the strangest part of her conduct, for at the same time she nudged
      with her knee the Chamberlain who sat next to her, and who had brought her
      into the room. To cap the marvel, he showed no surprise, but took her hint
      with a conspirator's enforced composure. He looked at the little,
      dried-up, squeaking creature opposite, and&mdash;refused the lady the
      gratification of a single sign of the amusement she had apparently
      expected. She reddened, bit her nether lip, and &ldquo;Your poor man of business
      is in a sore plight,&rdquo; she whispered, using the name Sim with significant
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Kate,&rdquo; said he quietly, &ldquo;as God's my judge, I can find nothing to
      laugh at in the misery of a poor wretch like yon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the second time!&rdquo; she whispered with well-concealed ill-humour, a
      smile compelled upon her face but a serpent in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second time?&rdquo; he repeated, lifting his eyebrows questioning, and
      always keeping a shoulder to her&mdash;a most chilly exterior. &ldquo;Your
      ladyship is in the humour to give guesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a swift reply to some only half-heard remark by her next-hand
      neighbour, then whispered to him, &ldquo;It's the second time you have been
      cruel to me to-day. You seem bent on making me unhappy, and it is not what
      you promised. Am I not looking nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said he calmly, &ldquo;do you know I am not in the mood for
      making sport of an old fool to prove my Kindness of heart to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me, Sim!&rdquo; she whispered, the serpent all gone from her voice, and a
      warm, dulcet, caressing accent in it, while her eyes were melting with
      discreetly veiled love. &ldquo;And I plotted so much to get beside you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the damned thing,&rdquo; he replied between his teeth, and smiling the
      while to some comment of his other neighbour, &ldquo;you plot too much, my dear.
      I do not want to be unkind, but a little less plotting would become you
      more. I have no great liking for your husband, as you may guess; but there
      he's covered with compote and confusion, and for the look of the thing, if
      for no more, it would suit his wife to pretend some sympathy. In any case,
      for God's sake do not look at me as if I shared your amusement at his
      trouble. And I'm sure that Elchies by his glowering saw you eat my plum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo cast a glance of disdain at the poor object she was bound to
      by a marriage for position and money, and for a moment or two gave no
      attention to the society of his Grace's Chamberlain, who was so
      suspiciously in her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon MacTaggart played idly with the stem of his glass. He was odd in
      that bibulous age, inasmuch as he never permitted wine to tempt his palate
      to the detriment of his brains, and he listened gravely to the
      conversation that was being monopolised at the head of the table round the
      Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women liked him. Indeed women loved this Chamberlain of Argyll readily,
      more for his eyes and for his voice and for some odd air of mystery and
      romance in his presence than for what generally pass for good looks. He
      had just the history and the career and reputation that to men and women,
      except the very wisest and the somewhat elderly, have an attraction all
      unreasonable; for his youth had been stormy; he had known great dangers,
      tremendous misfortunes, overcoming both by a natural&mdash;sometimes
      spendthrift&mdash;courage; he was credited with more than one amorous
      intrigue, that being in high quarters was considered rather in his favour
      than otherwise; he was high in the esteem of families in the social scale
      considerably above his own (that had greatly declined since his people
      could first boast a coat impaled with the galley of Lome); he was alert,
      mind and body, polite to punctilio, a far traveller, a good talker, and
      above all a lover of his kind, so that he went about with a smile (just
      touched a little by a poetic melancholy) for all. To the women at Argyll's
      table he was the most interesting man there, and though materially among
      the least eminent and successful, had it been his humour to start a topic
      of his own in opposition to his patron's, he could have captured the
      interest of the gathering in a sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Simon MacTaggart was for once not in the mood for the small change of
      conversation. Some weighty thought possessed him that gave his eye a
      remote quality even when he seemed to be sharing the general attention in
      the conversation, and it was as much resentment at the summons from his
      abstraction and his mood as a general disinclination to laugh at a
      wretch's misery on the bidding of the wretch's wife, that made him so curt
      to Mrs. Petullo's advances. To him the dinner seemed preposterously
      unending. More than once his hand went to his fob with an unconscious
      response to his interest in the passage of the time; with difficulty he
      clenched his teeth upon the yawns that followed his forced smiles at the
      murmured pleasantries of the humble bailies and town councillors in his
      midst, who dared only venture on a joke of their own, and that discreetly
      muffled, when there was a pause in the conversation of the Duke and the
      Judges. And to the woman at his shoulder (the one on his left&mdash;the
      wife of the Provost, a little fair-haired doll with a giggling
      appreciation of the importance of her situation in such grand company, and
      a half-frightened gladness at being so near MacTaggart) he seemed more
      mysterious and wonderful than ever. Mrs. Petullo, without looking at his
      half-averted face, knew by the mere magnetic current from his cold
      shoulder that of her he was just now weary, that with his company as a
      whole he was bored, and that some interest beyond that noisy hall engaged
      his abstracted thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Duke was saying; &ldquo;the murderer has not been discovered, nor
      indeed have we the most important evidence that there was a murder at all&mdash;for
      the body itself is as yet a mere matter of rumour, though of its existence
      there is no reasonable ground for doubt. It was carried off, as I am
      informed, by the Macfarlanes, whose anxiety to hush the affair is our main
      proof that they were on no honest expedition when this happened. But an
      affair like that gets bruited abroad: it came to us from Cairndhu that the
      corpse of a Macfarlane was carried past in the gloaming by some of his
      friends, anxious to get it smuggled through Ard-kinglas with as little
      public notice as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Acta exteriora indicant interiora seceta</i>, to somewhat misapply a
      well-kent maxim. The <i>res gesto</i> show, I think, that it was a murder
      on the part of the robbers themselves.&rdquo; It was Elchies who spoke, cracking
      filberts the while with his great yellow teeth that gave him so cruel a
      look upon the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain suddenly, &ldquo;the man was shot by
      a French pistol,&rdquo; and a hush fell on the table in expectation of further
      details, but they were not forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm astonished to hear it, and I hope you know where to lay hands
      on the homicide,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of our affair&mdash;nowadays,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain. &ldquo;And,
      forbye, I'm only telling a carried tale after all. There may be no more in
      it than the fancy of the Glen Fyne folk who told me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke looked at his Chamberlain, saw that the topic, so far as he was
      concerned, was ended, and signalled to the Duchess. It was not the custom
      of the time, but her Grace had introduced into her Highland court the
      practice of withdrawing the ladies for some time after dinner, and leaving
      the men to their birling of the wine, as they phrased it. Out she swept at
      her husband's signal with her company&mdash;Lady Strachur, Lady Charlotte,
      Mrs. Petullo, the Provost's wife, and three or four of no greater
      importance to our story&mdash;and of all that were left behind, perhaps
      there was none but her husband, who, oddly' enough (as people thought) for
      a duke, loved her as if he were a boy courting still, to reflect that the
      room was colder and less human wanting the presence of her and her bright
      company. His Grace, who cared for the bottle even less than did his
      Chamberlain, slid round the wine sun-wise for a Highlander's notion of
      luck; the young advocates, who bleared somewhat at the eyes when they
      forgot themselves, felt the menacing sleepiness and glowing content of
      potations carried to the verge of indiscretion; Kilkerran hummed, Petullo
      hawed, the Provost humbly ventured a sculduddery tale, the Duke politely
      listening the while to some argument of Elchies upon the right of any one
      who had been attacked by the Macfarlanes to use arms against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a well-allowed principle, your Grace,&rdquo; he maintained. &ldquo;<i>Arma in
      armatos sumere jura sinunt</i>&mdash;the possessor may use violence to
      maintain his possession, but not to recover that of which he has been
      deprived.&rdquo; He looked like a Barbary ape as his shrunk jaws masticated the
      kernels he fed to his mouth with shaking claws: something deep and
      foxishly cunning peered forth below his bristling red eyebrows. The Duke
      could not but look at his protruding ears and experience an old sensation
      of his in the company of the more animal of his fellows, that, after all,
      man with a little practice might easily swing among trees or burrow in the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ill-trained servant removing empty bottles left the door open behind
      his Grace's chair, and through it came the strains of a duet in women's
      voices, accompanied by the strumming of a harp. They sang an English air
      touching upon groves and moonlit waterfalls, Lady Charlotte lending a
      dulcet second to the air of the Duchess, who accompanied them upon her
      instrument in sweeping chords and witching faint arpeggios. Into the room
      that fumed with tobacco and wine (and the Provost at the second of his
      tales in the ear of the advocate) the harmony floated like the praise of
      cherubim, and stilled at once the noisy disquisition round the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the door open,&rdquo; said the Duke to his servants, and they did so.
      When the song was done he felt his Jean was calling to him irresistible,
      and he suggested that they had better join the ladies. They rose&mdash;some
      of them reluctantly&mdash;from the bottles, Elchies strewing his front
      again with snuff to check his hiccoughs. MacTaggart, in an aside to the
      Duke, pleaded to be excused for his withdrawal immediately, as he felt
      indisposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed that you were gey glum to-night,&rdquo; said Argyll with a kind and
      even fraternal tone, for they were cousins and confidants as well as in a
      purely business relation to each-other. &ldquo;I'm thinking we both want some of
      the stimulant Elchies and the Provost and the advocate lads take so
      copiously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the Chamberlain; &ldquo;but Sassenachs, Argyll, but Sassenachs, and
      they need it all. As for us, we're born with a flagon of heather ale
      within us, and we may be doing without the drug they must have, poor
      bodies, to make them sparkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll laughed. &ldquo;Good-night, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and a riddance to your
      vapours before the morning's morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo had begun a song before the Duke entered, a melody of the
      Scots mode, wedded to words that at that period hummed round the country.
      It was the one triumphant moment of her life&mdash;her musically vocal&mdash;when
      she seemed, even to the discriminating who dive for character below the
      mere skin, to be a perfect angel. Pathos, regret, faith, hope, and love,
      she could simulate marvellously: the last was all that was really hers,
      and even that was lawless. She had not half-finished the air when the Duke
      came into the room softly on his tiptoes, humming her refrain. A keen ear
      might have perceived the slightest of alterations in the tone of her next
      stanza; a quick eye might have noticed a shade of disappointment come to
      her face when her intent but momentary glance at the door revealed that
      some one she sought was not entering. The only ear that heard, the only
      eye that saw, was Kilkerran's. He was a moralist by repute, and he would
      have suspected without reasons. When Mrs. Petullo broke down miserably&mdash;in
      her third verse, he smiled to himself pawkily, went up to her with a
      compliment, and confirmed his suspicions by her first question, which was
      as to the Chamberlain's absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Chamberlain, he was by now hurrying with great speed through
      the castle garden. Only once he slacked his pace, and that was when the
      garden path joined the more open policies of the Duke, and another step or
      two would place a thicket of laburnums and hawthorns between him and the
      sight of the litten windows. He hung on his heel and looked back for a
      minute or two at the castle, looming blackly in the darkness against the
      background of Dunchuach; he could hear the broken stanza of Mrs. Petullo's
      ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amn't I the damned fool?&rdquo; said he half-aloud to himself with bitter
      certainty in the utterance. &ldquo;There's my punishment: by something sham&mdash;and
      I ken it's sham too&mdash;I must go through life beguiled from right and
      content. Here's what was to be the close of my folly, and Sim MacTaggart
      eager to be a good man if he got anything like a chance, but never the
      chance for poor Sim MacTaggart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He plunged into the darkness of the road that led to the Maltland barracks
      where the fifty claymores were quartered.

      Count Victor heard the woman's lamentation die away in the pit of the
      stair before he ceased to wonder at the sound and had fully realised the
      unpleasantness of his own incarceration. It was the cries of the outer
      assault that roused him from mere amazement to a comprehension of the
      dangers involved in his being thus penned in a cell and his enemies kept
      at bay by some wooden bars and a wooden-head. He felt with questioning
      fingers along the walls, finding no crevice to suggest outer air till he
      reached the window, and, alas! an escape from a window at that height
      seemed out of the question without some machinery at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected the little clown's laughter,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;The key of
      the mystery lies between him and this absurd Baron, and I begin to guess
      at something of complicity on the part of M. Bethune. A malediction on the
      whole tribe of mountaineers! The thing's like a play; I've seen far more
      improbable circumstances in a book. I am shot at in a country reputed to
      be well-governed even to monotony; a sombre host puzzles, a far too frank
      domestic perplexes; magic flutes and midnight voices haunt this infernal
      hold; the conventional lady of the drama is kept in the background with
      great care, and just when I am on the point of meeting her, the perplexing
      servitor becomes my jailer. But yes, it is a play; surely it is a play; or
      else I am in bed in Cammercy suffering from one of old Jeanne's heavy late
      suppers. It is then that I must waken myself into the little room with the
      pink hangings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the point of the sword to prick his finger, more in a humorous
      mood than with any real belief that it was all a dream, and dropped it
      fast as he felt a gummy liquor clotting on the blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Grand Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said he softly, &ldquo;I have perhaps pricked some one else
      to-night into his eternal nightmare, and I cannot prick myself out of
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the men outside rose louder; a gleam of light waved upon the
      wall of the chamber, something wan and elusive, bewildering for a moment
      as if it were a ghost; from the clamour he could distinguish sentences in
      a guttural tongue. He turned to the window&mdash;the counterpart of the
      one in his own bedroom, but without a pane of glass in its narrow space.
      Again the wan flag waved across the wall, more plainly the cries of the
      robbers came up to him. They had set a torch flaring on the scene. It
      revealed the gloomy gable-end of Doom with a wild, a menacing
      illumination, deepening the blackness of the night beyond its influence,
      giving life to shadows that danced upon rock and grass. The light, held
      high by the man Count Victor had wounded, now wrapped to his eyes in a
      plaid, rose and fell, touched sometimes on the mainland showing the
      bracken and the tree, sometimes upon the sea to show the wave, frothy from
      its quarrel with the fissured rock, making it plain that Doom was a ship
      indeed, cast upon troubled waters, cut off from the gentle world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But little for the sea or for the shore had Count Victor any interest; his
      eyes were all for the wild band who clamoured about the flambeau. They
      wore such a costume as he had quarrelled with on his arrival; they cried
      &ldquo;Loch Sloy!&rdquo; with something of theatrical effect, and &ldquo;Out with the
      gentleman! out with Black Andy's murderer!&rdquo; they demanded in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      He craned his head out at the Window and watched the scene. The tall man
      who had personally assailed him seemed to lead the band in all except
      their clamour, working eagerly, directing in undertones. They had brought
      a ladder from the shore, apparently provided for such an emergency, and
      placed it against the wall, with a view to an escalade. A stream of
      steaming water shot down upon the first who ventured upon the rounds, and
      he fell back with ludicrous whimperings. Compelled by the leader, another
      ventured on the ladder, and the better to watch his performance Count
      Victor leaned farther out at his window, secure from observation in the
      darkness. As he did so, he saw for the first time that on his right there
      was a lighted window he could almost touch with his hand as he leaned
      over. It flashed upon him that here was the woman's room, and that on the
      deep moulding running underneath the windows he could at some little risk
      gain it, probably to find its door open, and thus gain the freedom Mungo
      had so unexpectedly taken from him. He crept out upon the ledge, only then
      to realise the hazards of such a narrow footing. It seemed as he stood
      with his hands yet grasping the sides of the window he sought to escape
      by, that he could never retain his balance sufficiently to reach the other
      in safety. The greatest of his physical fears&mdash;greater even than that
      of drowning which sometimes whelmed him in dreams and on ships&mdash;was
      the dread of empty space; a touch of vertigo seized him; the enemy
      gathered round the torch beneath suddenly seemed elves, puny impossible
      things far off, and he almost slipped into their midst. But he dragged
      back his senses. &ldquo;We must all die,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;but we need not be
      precipitate about the business,&rdquo; and shut his eyes as he stood up, and
      with feet upon the moulding stretched to gain grip of the other window.
      Something fell away below his right foot and almost plunged him into
      space. With a terrific effort he saved himself from that fate, and his
      senses, grown of a sudden to miraculous acuteness, heard the crumbled
      masonry he had released thud upon the patch of grass at the foot of the
      tower, apprising the enemy of his attempt. A wild commingling of commands
      and threats came up to him; the night seemed something vast beyond all
      former estimates, a swinging and giddy horror; the single star that peered
      through the cloud took to airy dancing, a phantom of the evening heavens;
      again he might have fallen, but the material, more deadly, world he was
      accustomed to manifested itself for his relief and his salvation. Through
      the night rang a pistol shot, and the ball struck against the wall but an
      inch or two from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci beaucoup!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;There is nothing like a pill,&rdquo; and his
      grasp upon the sides of the illuminated window was quite strong and
      confident as he drew himself towards it. He threw himself in upon the
      floor just in time to escape death from half a dozen bullets that rattled
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safe within, he looked around in wonder. What he had come upon was not
      what he had expected,&mdash;was, indeed, so incongruous with the cell next
      door and the general poverty of the castle as a whole that it seemed
      unreal; for here was a trim and tasteful boudoir lit by a silver lamp,
      warmed by a charcoal fire, and giving some suggestion of dainty womanhood
      by a palpable though delicate odour of rose-leaves conserved in
      pot-pourri. Tapestry covered more than three-fourths of the wall, swinging
      gently in the draught from the open window, a harpischord stood in a
      corner, a couch that had apparently been occupied stood between the
      fireplace and the door, and a score of evidences indicated gentility and
      taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annapla becomes more interesting,&rdquo; he reflected, but he spent no time in
      her boudoir; he made to try the door. It was locked; nor did he wonder at
      it, though in a cooler moment he might have done so. Hurriedly he glanced
      about the room for something to aid him to open the door, but there was
      nothing to suit his purpose. In his search his eye fell upon a miniature
      upon the mantelshelf&mdash;the work, as he could tell by its technique and
      its frame, of a French artist. It was the presentment of a gentleman in
      the Highland dress, adorned, as was the manner of some years back before
      the costume itself had become discredited, with fripperies of the mode
      elsewhere&mdash;a long scalloped waistcoat, a deep ruffled collar, the
      shoes buckled, and the hair <i>en queue</i>,&mdash;the portrait of a man
      of dark complexion, distinguished and someways pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The essential lover of the story,&rdquo; said Count Victor, putting it down.
      &ldquo;Now I know my Annapla is young and lovely. We shall see&mdash;we shall
      see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the door to try its fastenings with his sword, found the task
      of no great difficulty, for the woodwork round the lock shared the common
      decay of Doom, and with the silver lamp to light his steps, he made his
      way along the corridor and down the stair. It was a strange and romantic
      spectacle he made moving thus through the darkness, the lamp swaying his
      shadow on the stairway as he descended, and he could have asked for no
      more astonishment in the face of his jailer than he found in Mungo's when
      that domestic met him at the stair-foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo was carrying hot water in a huge kettle. He put down the vessel with
      a startled jolt that betrayed his fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be aboot us! Coont, ye near gied me a stroke there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I demand pardon!&rdquo; said Count Victor ironically. &ldquo;I forgot that a man
      of your age should not be taken by surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My age!&rdquo; repeated Mungo, with a tone of annoyance. &ldquo;No' sae awfu' auld
      either. At my age my grandfaither was a sergeant i' the airmy, and married
      for the fourth time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only half his valour seems to run in the blood,&rdquo; said Count Victor. Then,
      more sternly, &ldquo;What did you mean by locking me up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo took up the kettle and placed it to the front of him, with some
      intuition that a shield must be extemporised against the sword that the
      Frenchman had menacing in his hand. The action was so droll and futile
      that, in spite of his indignation, Count Victor had to smile; and this
      assured the little domestic, though he felt chagrin at the ridicule
      implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jist a bit plan o' my ain, Coont, to keep ye oot o' trouble, and I'm
      shair ye'll excuse the leeberty. A bonny-like thing it wad be if the
      maister cam' hame and foun' the Macfarlanes wer oot on the ran-dan and had
      picked ye oot o' Doom like a wulk oot o' its shell. It wisna like as if ye
      were ane o' the ordinar garrison, ye ken; ye were jist a kin' o' veesitor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was I they were after,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;which surely gave me
      some natural interest in the defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye were safer to bide whaur ye were; and hoo ye got oot o't 's mair than
      I can jalouse. We hae scalded aff the rogues wi' het water, and if they're
      to be keepit aff, I'll hae to be unco gleg wi' the kettle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words he saw, apparently for the first time, with a full
      understanding of its significance, the lamp in Count Victor's hands. His
      jaw fell; he put down the kettle again helplessly, and, in trembling
      tones, &ldquo;Whaur did ye get the lamp?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah, mon vieux!</i>&rdquo; cried Count Victor, enjoying his bewilderment.
      &ldquo;You should have locked the lady's door as well as mine. 'Art a poor
      warder not to think of the possibilities in two cells so close to each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cells!&rdquo; cried Mungo, very much disturbed. &ldquo;Cells! quo' he,&rdquo; looking
      chapfallen up the stairway, as if for something there behind his escaped
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you will give me the opportunity of paying my respects to your no
      doubt adorable lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; cried Mungo, incredulous. A glow came to his face. He showed the
      ghost of a mischievous smile. &ldquo;Is't that way the lan' lies? Man, ye're a
      dour birkie!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but a wilf u' man maun hae his way, and, if
      naething less'll dae ye, jist gang up to yer ain chaumer, and ye'll find
      her giein' the Macfarlanes het punch wi' nae sugar till't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The statement was largely an enigma to Count Victor, but he understood
      enough to send him up the stairs with an alacrity that drove Mungo, in his
      rear, into silent laughter. Yet the nearer he came to his door the slower
      grew his ascent. At first he had thought but of the charming lady, the
      vocalist, and the recluse. The Baron's share in the dangerous mystery of
      Doom made him less scrupulous than he might otherwise have been as to the
      punctilio of a domestic's introduction to one apparently kept out of his
      way for reasons best known to his host; and he advanced to the encounter
      in the mood of the adventurer, Mungo in his rear beholding it in his
      jaunty step, in the fingers that pulled and peaked the moustachio, and
      drew forth a somewhat pleasing curl that looked well across a temple. But
      a more sober mood overcame him before he had got to the top of the stair.
      The shouts of the besieging party outside had declined and finally died
      away; the immediate excitement of the adventure, which with Mungo and the
      unknown lady he was prepared to share, was gone. He began to realise that
      there was something ludicrous in the incident that had kept him from
      making her acquaintance half an hour ago, and reflected that she might
      well have some doubt of his courage and his chivalry. Even more perturbing
      was the sudden recollection of the amused laughter that had greeted his
      barefooted approach to Doom through two or three inches of water, and at
      the open door he hung back dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step in; it's your ain room,&rdquo; cried Mungo, struggling with his kettle;
      &ldquo;and for the Lord's sake mind your mainners and gie her a guid
      impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the very counsel to make a Montaiglon bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered; a woman was busy at the open window; he stared in amazement
      and chagrin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII &mdash; OMENS AND ALARMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beaten back by Annapla's punch-bowl from their escalade, the assailants
      rallied to a call from their commander, and abandoned, for the time at
      least, their lawless enterprise. They tossed high their arms, stamped out
      their torch to blackness, shouted a ribald threat, and were swallowed up
      by the black mainland. A gentle rain began to fall, and the sea lapsed
      from a long roll to an oily calm. With no heed for the warnings and
      protests of Mungo, whose intrepidity was too obviously a merely mental
      attitude and incapable of facing unknown dangers, Count Victor lit a
      lantern and went out again into the night that now held no rumour of the
      band who had so noisily menaced. There was profound silence on the shore
      and all along the coast&mdash;a silence the more sinister because peopled
      by his enemies. He went round the castle, his lantern making a beam of
      yellow light before him, showing the rain falling in silvery threads,
      gathering in silver beads upon his coat and trickling down the channels of
      his weapon. A wonderful fondness for that shaft of steel possessed him at
      the moment: it seemed a comrade faithful, his only familiar in that
      country of marvels and dreads; it was a comfort to have it hand in hand;
      he spoke to it once in affectionate accents as if it had been a thing of
      life. The point of it suggested the dark commander, and Count Victor
      scrutinised the ground beside the dyke-side where he had made the thrust:
      to his comfort only a single gout of blood revealed itself, for he had
      begun to fear something too close on a second homicide, which would make
      his presence in the country the more notorious. A pool of water still
      smoking showed where Annapla's punch-bowl had done its work; but for the
      blood and that, the alarms of the night might have seemed to him a dream.
      Far off to the south a dog barked; nearer, a mountain torrent brawled
      husky in its chasm. Perfumes of the wet woodland mingled with the odours
      of the shore. And the light he carried made Doom Castle more dark, more
      sinister and mysterious than ever, rising strong and silent from his feet
      to the impenetrable blackness overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the garden, he stood in the bower. There more than anywhere
      else the desolation was pitiful&mdash;the hips glowing crimson on their
      stems, the eglantine in withering strands, the rustic woodwork green with
      damp and the base growths of old and mouldering situations, the seat
      decayed and broken, but propped at its feet as if for recent use. All
      seemed to express some poignant anguish for lost summers, happy days, for
      love and laughter ravished and gone for ever. Above all, the rain and sea
      saddened the moment&mdash;the rain dripping through the ragged foliage and
      oozing on the wood, the cavernous sea lapping monstrous on the rock that
      some day yet must crumble to its hungry maw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held high the lantern, and to a woman at her darkened window her bower
      seemed to glow like a shell lit in the depths of troubled ocean. He swung
      the light; a footstep, that he did not hear, was checked in wonder. He
      came out, and instinct told him some one watched him in the dark beyond
      the radiance of his lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Qui est la?</i>&rdquo; he cried, forgetting again the foreign country,
      thinking himself sentinel in homely camps, and when he spoke a footstep
      sounded in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one had crossed from the mainland while he ruminated within. He
      listened, with the lantern high above his head but to the right of him for
      fear of a pistol-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      One footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced slowly to meet it, his fingers tremulous on his sword, and the
      Baron came out of the darkness, his hands behind his back, his shoulders
      bent, his visage a mingling of sadness and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. le Baron?&rdquo; said Count Victor, questioning, but he got no answer. Doom
      came up to him and peered at him as if he had been a ghost, a tear upon
      his cheek, something tense and troubled in his countenance, that showed
      him for the moment incapable of calm utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;are late,&rdquo; stammered Count Victor, putting the sword
      behind him and feeling his words grotesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took&mdash;I took you for a wraith&mdash;I took you for a vision,&rdquo; said
      the Baron plaintively. He put his hand upon his guest's arm. &ldquo;Oh, man!&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;if you were Gaelic, if you were Gaelic, if you could understand!
      I came through the dark from a place of pomp, from a crowded street, from
      things new and thriving, and above all the castle of his Grace flaring
      from foundation to finial like a torch, though murder was done this day in
      the guise of justice: I came through the rain and the wet full of
      bitterness to my poor black home, and find no light there where once my
      father and my father's father and all the race of us knew pleasant hours
      in the wildest weather. Not a light, not a lowe&mdash;&rdquo; he went on, gazing
      upward to the frowning walls dark glistening in the rain&mdash;&ldquo;and then
      the bower must out and shine to mind me&mdash;to mind me&mdash;ah,
      Mont-aiglon, my pardons, my regrets! you must be finding me a melancholy
      host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not mention it,&rdquo; said Count Victor carelessly, though the conduct of
      this marvel fairly bewildered him, and his distress seemed poorly
      accounted for by his explanation. &ldquo;<i>Ah, vieux blagueur!</i>&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;can it be Balhaldie again&mdash;a humbug with no heart in his breast but
      an onion in his handkerchief?&rdquo; And then he was ashamed of suspicions of
      which a day or two ago he would have been incapable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends of Monday did me the honour to call in your absence,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;They have not gone more than twenty minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the Macfarlanes,&rdquo; cried Doom, every trace of his softer emotion
      gone, but more disturbed than ever as he saw the sword for the first time.
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;well?&rdquo; he inquired eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well?&rdquo; and he gripped Count Victor by the arm and looked him
      in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing serious happened,&rdquo; replied Count Victor, &ldquo;except that your
      domestics suffered some natural alarms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom seemed wonderously relieved. &ldquo;The did not force an entrance?&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did their best, but failed. I pricked one slightly before I fell
      back on Mungo's barricades; that and some discomfiture from Mistress
      Annapla's punch-bowl completed the casualties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? well? well?&rdquo; cried Lamond, still waking something. Count Victor
      only looked at him in wonder, and led the way to the door where Mungo drew
      back the bars and met his master with a trembling front. A glance of mute
      inquiry and intelligence passed between the servant and his master: the
      Frenchman saw it and came to his own conclusions, but nothing was said
      till the Baron had made a tour of investigation through the house and come
      at last to join his guest in the <i>salle</i>, where the embers of the
      fire were raked together on the hearth and fed with new peat. The Count
      and his host sat down together, and when Mungo had gone to prepare some
      food for his master, Count Victor narrated the night's adventure. He had
      an excited listener&mdash;one more excited, perhaps, than the narrative of
      itself might account for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is much that is beyond my poor comprehension,&rdquo; continued Count
      Victor, looking at him as steadfastly as good breeding would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Doom, stretching fingers that trembled to the peat-flame that
      stained his face like wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant Mungo was quite unnecessarily solicitous for my safety, and
      took the trouble to put me under lock and key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom fingered the bristles of his chin in a manifest perturbation. &ldquo;He&mdash;he
      did that, did he?&rdquo; said he, like one seeking to gain time for further
      reflection. And when Count Victor waited some more sympathetic comment,
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;it was very stupid, very stupid of Mungo,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; echoed Count Victor ironically. &ldquo;Ah! so it was. I should not
      have said stupid myself, but it so hard, is it not, for a foreigner to
      find the just word in his poor vocabulary? For a <i>bêtise</i> much less
      unpleasant I have scored a lackey's back with a scabbard. Master Mungo had
      an explanation, however, though I doubted the truth of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you would be angry if he permitted me to get into danger while I was
      your guest,&mdash;an excuse more courteous than convincing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was right,&rdquo; said Doom, &ldquo;though I can scarcely defend the manner of
      executing his trust: I was not to see that he would make a trepanning
      affair of it. I'm&mdash;I'm very much grieved, Count, much grieved, I
      assure you: I shall have a word or two on the matter the morn's morning
      with Mungo. A stupid action! a stupid action! but you know the man by this
      time&mdash;an oddity out and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little too much so, if I may take the liberty, M. le Baron,&mdash;a
      little too much so for a foreigner's peace of mind,&rdquo; said Count Victor
      softly. &ldquo;Are you sure, M. le Baron, there are no traitors in Doom?&rdquo; and he
      leaned forward with his gaze on the Baron's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron started, flushed more crimson than before, and turned an alarmed
      countenance to his interrogator. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are you bringing
      your doubts of the breed of us to my hearthstone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absurd, perhaps,&rdquo; said Count Victor, still very softly, and
      watching his host as closely as he might, &ldquo;but Mungo&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! a good lowland heart! For all his clowning, Count, you might trust
      him with your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other servant then&mdash;the woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom looked a trifle uneasy. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said he, with half a glance behind
      him to the door. &ldquo;Not so loud. If she should hear!&rdquo; he stammered: he
      stopped, then smiled awkwardly. &ldquo;Have ye any dread of an Evil Eye?&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no dread of the devil himself, who is something more tangible,&rdquo;
       replied Count Victor. &ldquo;You do not suggest that malevolent influence in
      Mistress Annapla, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very civil to her in these parts,&rdquo; said Doom, &ldquo;and I'm not keen to
      put her powers to the test. I have seen and heard some droll things of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has been my own experience,&rdquo; said Count Victor. &ldquo;Are you sure her
      honesty is on more substantial grounds than her reputation for witchcraft?
      I demand your pardon for expressing these suspicions, but I have reasons.
      I cannot imagine that the attack of the Macfarlanes was connived at by
      your servants, though that was my notion for a little when Mungo locked me
      up, for they suffered more alarm at the attack than I did, and the reason
      for the attack seems obvious enough. But are you aware that this woman who
      commands your confidence is in the practice of signalling to the shore
      when she wishes to communicate with some one there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be mistaken,&rdquo; said Doom, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could swear I saw something of the kind,&rdquo; said Count Victor. He
      described the signal he had seen twice at her window. &ldquo;Not having met her
      at the time, I laid it down to some gay gillian's affair with a lover on
      the mainland, but since I have seen her that idea seem&mdash;seems&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, I should think it did,&rdquo; said the Baron: but though his words
      were light, his aspect was disturbed. He paced once or twice up and down
      the floor, muttered something to himself in Gaelic, and finally went to
      the door, which he opened. &ldquo;Mungo, Mungo!&rdquo; he cried into the darkness, and
      the servant appeared with the gaudy nightcap of his slumber already on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Annapla to come here,&rdquo; said the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant hesitated, his lip trembled upon some objection that he did
      not, however, express, and he went on his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little the woman entered. It was not surprising that when Count
      Victor, prepared by all that had gone before to meet a bright young
      creature when he had gone into his chamber where she was repelling the
      escalade of the enemy, had been astounded to find what he found there, for
      Mistress Annapla was in truth not the stuff for amorous intrigues. She had
      doubtless been handsome enough in her day, but that was long distant; now
      there were but the relics of her good looks, with only her eyes, dark,
      lambent, piercing, to tell of passions unconsumed. She had eyes only for
      her master; Count Victor had no existence for her, and he was all the
      freer to watch how she received the Baron's examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dry your clothes at the windows in Doom?&rdquo; asked her master
      quietly, with none of a master's bluntness, asking the question in English
      from politeness to his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied rapidly in Gaelic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For luck,&rdquo; said the Baron dubiously when he had listened to a long
      guttural explanation that was of course unintelligible to the Frenchman.
      &ldquo;That's a new freit. To keep away the witches. Now, who gave ye a notion
      like that?&rdquo; he went on, maintaining his English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another rapid explanation followed, one that seemed to satisfy the Baron,
      for when it was finished he gave her permission to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as I thought,&rdquo; he explained to Count Victor. &ldquo;The old body has been
      troubled with moths and birds beating themselves against her window at
      night when the light was in it: what must she be doing but taking it for
      some more sinister visitation, and the green kerchief is supposed to keep
      them away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have fancied it might have been a permanency in that case,&rdquo;
       suggested Count Victor, &ldquo;unless, indeed, your Highland ghosts have a
      special preference for Mondays and Wednesdays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permanency!&rdquo; repeated the Baron, thoughtfully. &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; The suggestion had
      obviously struck him as reasonable, but he baulked at any debate on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was also the matter of the horseman,&rdquo; went on Count Victor blandly,
      pointing his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horseman?&rdquo; queried the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horseman <i>sans doute</i>. I noticed most of your people here ride
      with a preposterously short stirrup; this one rode like a gentleman
      cavalier. He stopped opposite the castle this forenoon and waved his
      compliments to the responsive maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect upon the Baron was amazing. He grew livid with some feeling
      repressed. It was only for a moment; the next he was for changing the
      conversation, but Count Victor had still his quiver to empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touching flageolets?&rdquo; said he, but there his arrow missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must trouble Annapla or Mungo. They have a story
      that the same's to be heard every night of storm, but my bed's at the
      other side of the house and I never heard it;&rdquo; and he brought the
      conversation back to the Macfarlanes, so that Count Victor had to
      relinquish his inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doings of to-night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;make it clear I must rid you of my
      presence <i>tout à l'heure</i>. I think I shall transfer me to the town
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't, man,&rdquo; protested Doom, though, it almost seemed, with some
      reluctance. &ldquo;There could be no worse time for venturing there. In the
      first place, the Macfarlanes' affair is causing a stir; then I've had no
      chance of speaking to Petullo about you. He was to meet me after the court
      was over, but his wife dragged him up with her to dinner in the castle.
      Lord! yon's a wife who would be nane the waur o' a leatherin', as they say
      in the south. Well, she took the goodman to the castle, though a dumb dog
      he is among gentrice, and the trip must have been little to his taste. I
      waited and better waited, and I might have been waiting for his
      home-coming yet, for it's candle-light to the top flat of MacCailen's
      tower and the harp in the hall. Your going, Count, will have to be put off
      a day or two longer.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII &mdash; A LAWYER'S GOOD LADY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The remainder of the night passed without further alarm, but Count Victor
      lay only on the frontiers of forgetfulness till morning, his senses all on
      sentry, and the salt, wind-blown dawn found him abroad before the rest of
      Doom was well awake. He met the calesh of the Lords going back the way it
      had come with an outrider in a red jacket from the stable of Argyll: it
      passed him on the highway so close that he saw Elchies and Kilkerran half
      sleeping within as they drove away from the scene of their dreadful
      duties. In a cloak of rough watchet blue he had borrowed from his host and
      a hat less conspicuous than that he had come in from Stirling, he passed,
      to such strangers in the locality, for some tacksman of the countryside,
      or a traveller like themselves. To have ventured into the town, however,
      where every one would see he was a stranger and speedily inquire into his
      business there, was, as he had been carefully apprised by Doom the night
      before, a risk too great to be run without good reason. Stewart's trial
      had created in the country a state of mind that made a stranger's presence
      there somewhat hazardous for himself, and all the more so in the case of a
      foreigner, for, rightly or wrongly, there was associated with the name of
      the condemned man as art and part in the murder that of a Highland officer
      in the service of the French. There had been rumours, too, of an attempted
      rescue on the part of the Stewarts of Ardshiel, Achnacoin, and Fasnacloich&mdash;all
      that lusty breed of the ancient train: the very numbers of them said to be
      on the drove-roads with weapons from the thatch were given in the town,
      and so fervently believed in that the appearance of a stranger without any
      plausible account to give of himself would have stirred up tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor eluded the more obvious danger of the town, but in his
      forenoon ramble stumbled into one almost as great as that he had been
      instructed to avoid. He had gone through the wood of Strongara and come
      suddenly upon the cavalcade that bore the doomed man to the scene of his
      execution thirty or forty miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretch had been bound upon a horse&mdash;a tall, middle-aged man in
      coarse home-spun clothing, his eye defiant, but his countenance white with
      the anxieties of his situation. He was surrounded by a troop of sabres;
      the horses' hoofs made a great clatter upon the hard road, and Count
      Victor, walking abstractedly along the river-bank, came on them before he
      was aware of their proximity. As he stood to let them pass he was touched
      inexpressibly by the glance the convict gave him, so charged was it with
      question, hope, dread, and the appetite for some human sympathy. He had
      seen that look before in men condemned&mdash;once in front of his own
      rapier,&mdash;and with the utmost feeling for the unhappy wretch he stood,
      when the cavalcade had gone, looking after it and conjuring in his fancy
      the last terrible scene whereof that creature would be the central figure.
      Thus was he standing when another horseman came upon him suddenly,
      following wide in the rear of the troops&mdash;a civilian who shared the
      surprise of the unexpected meeting. He had no sooner gazed upon Count
      Victor than he drew up his horse confusedly and seemed to hesitate between
      proceeding or retreat. Count Victor passed with a courteous salute no less
      formally returned. He was struck singularly by some sense of familiarity.
      He did not know the horseman who so strangely scrutinised him as he
      passed, but yet the face was one not altogether new to him. It was a face
      scarce friendly, too, and for his life the Frenchman could not think of
      any reason for aversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could no more readily have accounted for the action of the horseman had
      he known that he had ridden behind the soldiers but a few hundred yards
      after meeting with Count Victor when he turned off at one of the
      hunting-roads with which the ducal grounds abounded, and galloped
      furiously back towards the castle of Argyll. Nothing checked him till he
      reached the entrance, where he flung the reins to a servant and dashed
      into the turret-room where the Duke sat writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Sim!&rdquo; said his Grace, airily, yet with an accent of apprehension,
      &ldquo;you have come back sooner than I looked for: nothing wrong with the
      little excursion, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacTaggart leaned with both hands upon the table where his master wrote.
      &ldquo;They're all right, so far as I went with them,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but if your
      Grace in my position came upon a foreigner in the wood of Strongara&mdash;a
      gentleman by the looks of him and a Frenchman by his moustachio, all alone
      and looking after Sergeant Donald's company, what would your Grace's
      inference be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll, obviously, did not share much of his Chamberlain's excitement.
      &ldquo;There was no more than one there?&rdquo; he asked, sprinkling sand upon his
      finished letter. &ldquo;No! Then there seems no great excuse for your extreme
      perturbation, my good Sim. I'm lord of Argyll, but I'm not lord of the
      king's highway, and if an honest stranger cares to take a freeman's
      privilege and stand between the wind and Simon MacTaggart's dignity&mdash;Simon
      MacTaggart's very touchy dignity, it would appear&mdash;who am I that I
      should blame the liberty? You did not ride <i>ventre à terre</i> from
      Strongara (I see a foam-fleck on your breeches) to tell me we had a
      traveller come to admire our scenery? Come, come, Sim! I'll begin to think
      these late eccentricities of yours, these glooms, abstractions, errors,
      and anxieties and indispositions, and above all that pallid face of yours,
      are due to some affair of the heart.&rdquo; As he spoke Argyll pinched his
      kinsman playfully on the ear, quite the good companion, with none of the
      condescension that a duke might naturally display in so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacTaggart reddened and Argyll laughed, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Can I have hit
      it?&rdquo; he went on, quizzing the Chamberlain. &ldquo;See that you give me fair
      warning, and I'll practise the accustomed and essential reel. Upon my
      soul, I haven't danced since Lady Mary left, unless you call it so that
      foolish minuet. You should have seen her Grace at St. James's last month.
      Gad! she footed it like an angel; there's not a better dancer in London
      town. See that your wife's a dancer, whoever she may be, Sim; let her
      dance and sing and play the harpsichord or the clarsach&mdash;they are
      charms that will last longer than her good looks, and will not weary you
      so soon as that intellect that's so much in fashion nowadays, when every
      woman listens to every clever thing you say, that she may say something
      cleverer, or perhaps retail it later as her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacTaggart turned about impatiently, poked with his riding crop at the
      fire, and plainly indicated that he was not in the mood for badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that has nothing to do with my Frenchman, your Grace,&rdquo; said he
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, confound your Frenchman!&rdquo; retorted the Duke, coming over, turning up
      the skirts of his coat, and warming himself at the fire. &ldquo;Don't say
      Frenchman to me, and don't suggest any more abominable crime and intrigue
      till the memory of that miserable Appin affair is off my mind. I know what
      they'll say about that: I have a good notion what they're saying already&mdash;as
      if I personally had a scrap of animosity to this poor creature sent to the
      gibbet on Leven-side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you should have this Frenchman arrested for inquiry: I do not
      like the look of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll laughed. &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is the man gane wud? Have you any
      charge against this unfortunate foreigner who has dared to shelter himself
      in my woods? And if you have, do you fancy it is the old feudal times with
      us still, and that I can clap him in my dungeon&mdash;if I had such a
      thing&mdash;without any consultation with the common law-officers of the
      land? Wake up, Sim! wake up! this is '55, and there are sundry written
      laws of the State that unfortunately prevent even the Mac-Cailen Mor
      snatching a man from the footpath and hanging him because he has not the
      Gaelic accent and wears his hair in a different fashion from the rest of
      us. Don't be a fool, cousin, don't be a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as your Grace likes,&rdquo; said MacTaggart. &ldquo;But if this man's not in any
      way concerned in the Appin affair, he may very well be one of the French
      agents who are bargaining for men for the French service, and the one
      thing's as unlawful as the other by the act of 'thirty-six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; said Argyll, turning more grave, and shrewdly eyeing his
      Chamberlain&mdash;&ldquo;H'm! have you any particularly good reason to think
      that?&rdquo; He waited for no answer, but went on. &ldquo;I give it up, MacTaggart,&rdquo;
       said he, with a gesture of impatience. &ldquo;Gad! I cannot pretend to know half
      the plots you are either in yourself or listening on the outside of,
      though I get credit, I know, for planning them. All I want to know is,
      have you any reason to think this part of Scotland&mdash;and incidentally
      the government of this and every well-governed realm, as the libels say&mdash;would
      be bettered by the examination of this man? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacTaggart protested the need was clamant. &ldquo;On the look of the man I would
      give him the jougs,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's spy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; said Argyll, then coughed discreetly over a pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spy or agent,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, little abashed at the interjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet a gentleman by the look of him, said Sim MacTaggart, five minutes
      syne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's to prevent that?&rdquo; asked the Chamberlain almost sharply. &ldquo;Your
      Grace will admit it's nothing to the point,&rdquo; said he, boldly, and
      smilingly, standing up, a fine figure of a man, with his head high and his
      chest out. &ldquo;It was the toss of a bawbee whether or not I should apprehend
      him myself when I saw him, and if I had him here your Grace would be the
      first to admit my discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Grace is a little more judicious than to treat the casual pedestrian
      like a notour thief,&rdquo; said Argyll; &ldquo;and yet, after all, I dare say the
      matter may be left to your good judgment&mdash;that is, after you have had
      a word or two on the matter with Petullo, who will better be able to
      advise upon the rights to the persons of suspicious characters in our
      neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With never a word more said MacTaggart clapped on his hat, withdrew in an
      elation studiously concealed from his master, and fared at a canter to
      Petullo's office in the town. He fastened the reins to the ring at the
      door and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer sat in a den that smelt most wickedly of mildewed vellum,
      sealing-wax, tape, and all that trash that smothers the soul of man&mdash;the
      appurtenances of his craft. He sat like a sallow mummy among them, like a
      half-man made of tailor's patches, flanked by piles of docketed letters
      and Records closed, bastioned by deed-boxes blazoned with the indication
      of their offices&mdash;MacGibbon's Mortification, Dunderave Estate, Coil's
      Trust, and so on; he sat with a shrieking quill among these things, and
      MacTaggart entering to him felt like thanking God that he had never been
      compelled to a life like this in a stinking mortuary, with the sun outside
      on the windows and the clean sea and the singing wood calling in vain.
      Perhaps some sense of contrast seized the writer, too, as he looked up to
      see the Chamberlain entering with a pleasant, lively air of wind behind
      him, and health and vigour in his step, despite the unwonted wanness of
      his face. At least, in the glance Petullo gave below his shaggy eyebrows,
      there was a little envy as well as much cunning. He made a ludicrous
      attempt at smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Mr. MacTaggart! Glad to see you, Mr. MacTaggart. Sit ye
      down, Mr. MacTaggart. I was just thinking about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No ill, I hope,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, refusing a seat proffered; for
      anything of the law to him seemed gritty in the touch, and a three-legged
      stool would, he always felt, be as unpleasant to sit upon as a red-hot
      griddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Te-he!&rdquo; squeaked Petullo with an irritating falsetto. &ldquo;You must have your
      bit joke, Mr. MacTaggart. Did his Grace&mdash;did his Grace&mdash;I was
      just wondering if his Grace said anything to-day about my unfortunate
      accident with the compote yestreen.&rdquo; He looked more cunningly than ever at
      the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his Grace's class, Mr. Petullo, and incidentally in my own, nothing's
      said of a guest's gawkiness, though you might hardly believe it for a
      reason that I never could make plain to you, though I know it by
      instinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as to gawkiness, an accident of the like might happen to any one,&rdquo;
       said Petullo, irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's true,&rdquo; confessed the Chamberlain. &ldquo;But, tut! tut! Mr. Petullo,
      a compote's neither here nor there to the Duke. If you had spilt two of
      them it would have made no difference; there was plenty left. Never mind
      the dinner, Mr. Petullo, just now, I'm in a haste. There's a Frenchman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a wheen of Frenchmen, seemingly,&rdquo; said the writer, oracularly,
      taking to the trimming of his nails with a piece of pumice-stone he kept
      for the purpose, and used so constantly that they looked like talons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what the devil do you mean?&rdquo; cried Mac-Taggart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, go on with your business,&rdquo; squeaked Petullo, with an eye upon an
      inner door that led to his household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have his Grace's instructions to ask you about the advisability of
      arresting a stranger, seemingly a Frenchman, who is at this moment
      suspiciously prowling about the policies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whatna charge, Mr. MacTaggart, on whatna charge?&rdquo; asked the writer,
      taking a confident, even an insolent, tone, now that he was on his own
      familiar ground. &ldquo;Rape, arson, forgery, robbery, thigging, sorning,
      pickery, murder, or high treason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clap them all together, Mr. Petullo, and just call it local
      inconduciveness,&rdquo; cried MacTaggart. &ldquo;Simply the Duke may not care for his
      society. That should be enough for the Fiscal and Long Davie the dempster,
      shouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; said Petullo. &ldquo;It's a bit vague, Mr. MacTaggart, and I don't think
      it's mentioned in Forbes's 'Institutes.' Fifteen Campbell assessors and
      the baron bailie might have sent a man to the Plantations on that dittay
      ten years ago, but we live in different times, Mr. MacTaggart&mdash;different
      times, Mr. MacTaggart,&rdquo; repeated the writer, tee-heeing till his bent
      shoulders heaved under his seedy, ink-stained surtout coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we?&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain, with a laugh. &ldquo;I'm thinking ye forget a
      small case we had no further gone than yesterday, when a man with the
      unlucky name of Stewart&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, meaningly smiled, and made a
      gesture with his fingers across his neck, at the same time giving an odd
      sound with his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You're an awfu' man,&rdquo; cried Petullo, with the accent of a lout. &ldquo;I
      wonder if you're on the same track as myself, for I'm like the Hielan'
      soldier&mdash;I have a Frenchman of my own. There's one, I mean, up by
      there in Doom, and coming down here to-morrow or the day after, or as soon
      as I can order a lodging for him in the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; cried the secretary, amazingly dumfoundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing underhand about him, so far as I know, to give even his
      Grace an excuse for confining him, for it seems he's a wine merchant out
      of Bordeaux, one Montaiglon, come here on business, and stopped at Doom
      through an attack on his horse by the same Macfarlanes who are of interest
      to us for another reason, as was spoken of at his Grace's table last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's coming here?&rdquo; asked MacTaggart, incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a call from the Baron himself to-day to tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, there's no more to be said of our suspicions,&rdquo; said MacTaggart.
      &ldquo;Not in this form, at least.&rdquo; And he was preparing to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      A skirt rustled within the inner door, and Mrs. Petullo, flushed a little
      to her great becoming in spite of a curl-paper or two, and clad in a
      lilac-coloured negligee of the charmingest, came into the office with a
      well-acted start of surprise to find a client there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good morning! Mr. MacTaggart,&rdquo; she exclaimed, radiantly, while her
      husband scowled to himself, as he relapsed into the chair at his desk and
      fumbled with his papers. &ldquo;Good morning; I hope I have not interrupted
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. MacTaggart was just going, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Petullo.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cracked bell rang within, and the Chamberlain perceived an odour of
      cooking celery. Inwardly he cursed his forgetfulness, because it was plain
      that the hour for his call upon the writer was ill-chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My twelve-hours is unusual sharp to-day,&rdquo; said Petullo, consulting a
      dumpy horologe out of his fob. &ldquo;Would ye&mdash;would ye do me the honour
      of joining me?&rdquo; with a tone that left, but not too rudely, immediate
      departure as the Chamberlain's only alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; said MacTaggart. &ldquo;I rose late to-day, and my
      breakfast's little more than done with.&rdquo; He made for the door, Mrs.
      Petullo close in his cry and holding his eye, defying so hurried a
      departure, while she kept up a chattering about the last night's party.
      Her husband hesitated, but his hunger (he had the voracious appetite of
      such shrivelled atomies) and a wholesome fear of being accused of jealousy
      made him withdraw, leaving the office to the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      All MacTaggart's anger rose against madame for her machination. &ldquo;You saw
      me from the window,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it's a half-cooked dinner for the goodman
      to-day, I'll warrant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a most intoxicating laugh, all charged with some sweet velvety
      charm, put out her hands, and caught his. &ldquo;Oh, Lord! I wish it would choke
      him, Sim,&rdquo; said she, fervently, then lifted up her mouth and dropped a
      swooning eyelash over her passionate orbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adorable creature,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;she'll have rat-bane in his broth some
      day.&rdquo; He kissed her with no more fervour than if she had been a wooden
      figurehead, but she was not thus to be accepted: she put an arm quickly
      round his neck and pressed her passionate lips to his. Back he drew
      wincing. &ldquo;Oh, damnation!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; she exclaimed in wonder, and turned to assure herself
      that it was not that some one spied from the inner door, for Mac-Taggart's
      face had become exceeding pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;you are&mdash;you are so ferocious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, Sim?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Who taught me? Oh, Sim,&rdquo; she went on, pleadingly,
      &ldquo;be good to me. I'm sick, I'm <i>sick</i> of life, and you don't show you
      care for me a little bit. Do you love me, Sim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you would ask the question fifty times a-day if you
      had the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would need a hundred times a-day to keep up with your changing moods.
      Do you love me, Sim?&rdquo; She was smiling, with the most pathetic appeal in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look beautiful in that gown, Kate,&rdquo; said he, irrelevantly, not
      looking at it at all, but out at the window, where showed the gabbarts
      tossing in the bay, and the sides of the hill of Dunchuach all splashed
      with gold and crimson leafage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my gown, Sim,&rdquo; said she, stamping her foot, and pulling at the
      buttons of his coat. &ldquo;Once&mdash;oh, Sim, do you love me? Tell me, tell
      me, tell me! Whether you do or not, say it, you used to be such a splendid
      liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no lie,&rdquo; said he curtly; then to himself: &ldquo;Oh, Lord, give me
      patience with this! and I have brought it on myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> no lie. Oh, Sim!&rdquo; (And still she was turning wary eyes upon
      the door that led to her husband's retirement.) &ldquo;It <i>was</i> no lie;
      you're left neither love nor courtesy. Oh, never mind! say you love me,
      Sim, whether it's true or not: that's what it's come to with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I love you.&rdquo; He smiled, but at heart he grimaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you,&rdquo; said she, from custom waiting his protestation. But
      the Duke's Chamberlain was in no mood for protestations. He looked at her
      high temples, made bald by the twisted papilottes, and wondered how he
      could have thought that bold shoulder beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in a great hurry, Kate,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sorry to go, but there's my horse
      at the ring to prove the hurry I'm in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know; you're always in a hurry now with me: it wasn't always
      so. Do you hear the brute?&rdquo; Her husband's squeaky voice querulously
      shouting on a servant came to them from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant immediately after came to the door with an intimation that Mr.
      Petullo desired to know where the spirit-bottle was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows very well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petullo. &ldquo;Here is the key&mdash;no, I'll
      take it to him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not the drink he wants, but me, the pig,&rdquo; said she as the servant
      withdrew. &ldquo;Kiss me good afternoon, Sim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to God it was good-bye!&rdquo; thought he, as he smacked her vulgarly,
      like a clown at a country fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her hand across her mouth, and her eyes flashed indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something between us, Simon,&rdquo; said she, in an altered tone; &ldquo;it
      used not to be like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it did not,&rdquo; he thought bitterly, and not for the first time he
      missed something in her&mdash;some spirit of simplicity, freshness,
      flower-bloom, and purity that he had sought for, seen in many women, and
      found elusive, as the frost finds the bloom of flowers he would begem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband shrieked again, and with mute gestures they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain threw himself upon his horse as 'twere a mortal enemy, dug
      rowel-deep in the shuddering flesh, and the hoof-beats thundered on the
      causey-stones. The beast whinnied in its pain, reared, and backed to the
      breast wall of the bay. He lashed it wildly over the eyes with his whip,
      and they galloped up the roadway. A storm of fury possessed him; he saw
      nothing, heard nothing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV &mdash; CLAMOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Count Victor came through the woods from Strongara singularly disturbed by
      the inexplicable sense of familiarity which rose from his meeting with the
      horseman. It was a dry day and genial, yet with hints of rain on the
      horizon and white caps to the waves, betokening perhaps a storm not far
      distant. Children were in the wood of Dunderave&mdash;ruddy, shy children,
      gathering nuts and blackberries, with merriment haunting the landscape as
      it were in a picture by Watteau or a tale of the classics, where such
      figures happily move for ever and for ever in the right golden glamour.
      Little elves they seemed to Count Victor as he came upon them over an
      eminence, and saw them for the first time through the trees under tall
      oaks and pines, among whose pillars they moved as if in fairy cloisters,
      the sea behind them shining with a vivid and stinging blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come upon them frowning, his mind full of doubts as to the hazards
      of his adventure in Argyll, convinced almost that the Baron of Doom was
      right, and that the needle in the haystack was no more hopeless a quest
      than that he had set out on, and the spectacle of their innocence in the
      woodland soothed him like a psalm in a cathedral as he stood to watch.
      Unknowing of his presence there, they ran and played upon the grass, their
      lips stained with the berry-juice, their pillow-slips of nuts gathered
      beneath a bush of whin. They laughed, and chanted merry rhymes: a gaiety
      their humble clothing lent them touched the thickets with romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other circumstances than fate had set about his life, Count Victor
      might have been a good man&mdash;a good man not in the common sense that
      means paying the way, telling the truth, showing the open hand, respecting
      the law, going to Mass, loyalty to the woman and to a friend, but in the
      rare, wide manner that comprehends all these, and has its growth in human
      affection and religious faith. He loved birds; animals ever found him
      soft-handed; as for children&mdash;the <i>petites</i>&mdash;God bless
      them! was he not used to stand at his window at home and glow to see them
      playing in the street? And as he watched the urchins in the wood of
      Dunderave, far from the scenes he knew, children babbling in an uncouth
      language whose smallest word he could not comprehend, he felt an elevation
      of his spirit that he indulged by sitting on the grass above them, looking
      at their play and listening to their laughter as if it were an opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot his fears, his apprehensions, his ignoble little emprise of
      revenge; he felt a better man, and he had his reward as one shall ever
      have who sits a space with childish merriment and woodland innocence. In
      his case it was something more direct and tangible than the immaterial
      efflux of the soul, though that too was not wanting: he saw the signal
      kerchief being placed outside the window, that otherwise, reaching home
      too early, he had missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my last chance, if I leave to-morrow,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I shall satisfy
      myself as to the nocturnal visitor, the magic flautist, and the
      bewildering Annapla&mdash;and probably find the mystery as simple as the
      egg in the conjurer's bottle when all's ended!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night he yawned behind his hand at supper in the midst of his host's
      account of his interview with Petullo the Writer, who had promised to
      secure lodging for Count Victor in a day or two, and the Baron showed no
      disinclination to conclude their somewhat dull sederunt and consent to an
      early retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something pressing to do before I go to bed myself,&rdquo; he said,
      restoring by that simple confession some of Count Victor's first
      suspicions. They were to be confirmed before an hour was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to his room and weighed his duty to himself and to some
      unshaped rules of courtesy and conduct that he had inherited from a house
      more renowned for its sense of ceremonial honour, perhaps, than for
      commoner virtues. His instinct as a stranger in a most remarkable
      dwelling, creeping with mystery and with numberless evidences of things
      sinister and perhaps malevolent, told him it was fair to make a
      reconnaissance, even if no more was to be discovered than a servant's
      sordid amours. On the other hand, he could not deny to himself that there
      was what the Baronne de Chenier would have called the little Lyons
      shopkeeper in the suspicions he had against his host, and in the steps he
      proposed to take to satisfy his curiosity. He might have debated the
      situation with himself till midnight, or as long as Mungo's candles lasted
      him, had not a shuffling and cautious step upon the stair suggested that
      some one was climbing to the unused chambers above. Putting punctilio in
      his pocket, he threw open his door, and had before him a much-perplexed
      Baron of Doom, wrapped from neck to heel in a great plaid of sombre tartan
      and carrying a candle!
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom stammered an inaudible excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; said Count Victor, ironically in spite of himself, as he saw his
      host's abashed countenance. &ldquo;I fear I intrude on a masquerade. Pray, do
      not mind me. It was that I thought the upper flat uninhabited, and no one
      awake but myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have me somewhat at a disadvantage,&rdquo; said Doom coldly, resenting the
      irony. &ldquo;I'll explain afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively, there is no necessity,&rdquo; replied Count Victor, with a profound
      bow, and he re-entered and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer any debate between punctilio and precaution. He had
      seen the bulge of the dagger below Macnaughton's plaid, and the plaid
      itself had not been drawn too closely round the wearer to conceal wholly
      the unaccountable fact that he had a Highland dress beneath it. A score of
      reasons for this eccentric affair came to Montaiglon, but all of them were
      disquieting, not the least so the notion that his host conspired perhaps
      with the Macfarlanes, who sought their revenge for their injured clansman.
      He armed himself with his sword, blew out his candles, and, throwing
      himself upon his bed, lay waiting for the signal he expected. In spite of
      himself, sleep stole on him twice, and he awakened each time to find an
      hour was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a night of pouring rain. Great drops beat on the little window, a
      gargoyle poured a noisy stream of water, and a loud sea cried off the land
      and broke upon the outer edge of the rock of Doom. A loud sea and ominous,
      and it was hard for Count Victor, in that welter of midnight voices, to
      hear the call of an owl, yet it came to him by and by, as he expected,
      with its repetition. And then the flageolet, with its familiar and
      baffling melody, floating on a current of the wind that piped about the
      castle vents and sobbed upon the stairs. He opened his door, looked into
      the depths that fell with mouldering steps into the basement and upwards
      to the flight where the Baron had been going. Whether he should carry his
      inquiry further or retire and shut his door again with a forced
      indifference to these perplexing events was but the toss of a coin. As he
      listened a slight sound at the foot of the stair&mdash;the sound of a door
      softly closed and a bar run in deep channels&mdash;decided him, and he
      waited to confound the master of Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness the stern walls about him seemed to weigh upon his heart,
      and so imbued with vague terrors that he unsheathed his sword. A light
      revealed itself upon the stair; he drew back into his room, but left the
      door open, and when the bearer of the light came in front of his door he
      could have cried out loudly in astonishment, for it was not the Baron but
      a woman, and no woman that he had seen before, or had any reason to
      suspect the presence of in Doom Castle. They discovered each other
      simultaneously,&mdash;she, a handsome foreigner, fumbling to put a rapier
      behind him in discreet concealment, much astounded; he, a woman no more
      than twenty, in her dress and manner all incongruous with this savage
      domicile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his after years it was Count Victor's most vivid impression that her
      eyes had first given him the embarrassment that kept him dumb in her
      presence for a minute after she had come upon him thus strangely ensconced
      in the dark corridor. It was those eyes&mdash;the eyes of the woman born
      and bred by seas unchanging yet never the same; unfathomable, yet always
      inviting to the guess, the passionate surmise&mdash;that told him first
      here was a maiden made for love. A figure tremulous with a warm grace, a
      countenance perfect in its form, full of a natural gravity, yet quick to
      each emotion, turning from the pallor of sudden alarm to the flush of
      shyness or vexation. The mountains had stood around to shelter her, and
      she was like the harebell of the hills. Had she been the average of her
      sex he would have met her with a front of brass; instead there was
      confusion in his utterance and his mien. He bowed extremely low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame; pardon! I&mdash;I&mdash;was awakened by music, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her silence, unaccompanied even by a smile at the ridiculous nature of the
      recontre, and the proud sobriety of her visage, quickened him to a bolder
      sentiment than he had at first meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was awakened by music, and it seems appropriate. With madame's
      permission, I shall return to earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His foolish words perhaps did not quite reach her: the wind eddied noisily
      in the stair, that seemed, in the light from his open door, to gulp the
      blackness. Perhaps she did not hear, perhaps she did not fully understand,
      for she hesitated more than a moment, as if pondering, not a whit
      astonished or abashed, with her eyes upon his countenance. Count Victor
      wished to God that he had lived a cleaner life: somehow he felt that there
      were lines upon his face betraying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have been the cause of your disturbance,&rdquo; she said at last,
      calmly, in a voice with the music of lulled little waves running on fairy
      isles in summer weather, almost without a trace that English was not her
      natural tongue, and that faint innuendo of the mountain melody but adding
      to the charm of her accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor ridiculously pulled at his moustache, troubled by this <i>sang
      froid</i> where he might naturally have looked for perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon! I demand your pardon!&rdquo; was all that he could say, looking at the
      curl upon her shoulder that seemed uncommon white against the silk of her
      Indian shawl that veiled her form. She saw his gaze, instinctively drew
      closer her screen, then reddened at her error in so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the woman there!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It is ridiculous of me, but I have heard the
      signals and the music more than once and wondered. I did not know&rdquo;&mdash;he
      smiled the smile of the <i>flâneur</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I did not know it was, let
      me say, Orpheus and Eurydice, Orpheus with his lyre restored from among
      the constellations, and forgetting something of its old wonder. Madame, I
      hope Orpheus will not en-rheum himself by his serenading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips parted slightly, her eyes chilled&mdash;an indescribable thing,
      but a plain lesson for a man who knew her sex, and Count Victor, in that
      haughty instinct of her flesh and eye, saw that here was not the place for
      the approach and opening of flippant parlours in the Rue Beautreillis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I have not intruded for the first time,&rdquo; he went on, in a
      different tone. &ldquo;It must have been your chamber I somewhat unceremoniously
      broke into last night. Till this moment the presence of a lady in Doom
      Castle had not occurred to me&mdash;at least I had come to consider the
      domestic was the only one of her sex we had here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easily explained,&rdquo; said the lady, losing some of her hauteur, and
      showing a touch of eagerness to be set right in the stranger's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is positively not the necessity,&rdquo; protested Count Victor, realising
      a move gained, and delaying his withdrawal a moment longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must understand that&mdash;&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he interrupted as courteously as he might. &ldquo;The explanation is due
      from me, madame: I protest,&rdquo; said he, and she pouted. It gave her a look
      so bewitching, so much the aspect of a tempest bound in a cobweb, that he
      was compelled to smile, and for the life of her she could not but respond
      with a similar display. It seemed, when he saw her smile through her
      clouds, that he had wandered blindly through the world till now. France,
      far off in sunshine, brimming with laughter and song, its thousand
      interests, its innumerable happy associations, were of little account to
      the fact that now he was in the castle of Doom, under the same roof with a
      woman who charmed magic flutes, who endowed the dusks with mystery and
      surprise. The night piped from the vaults, the crumbling walls hummed with
      the incessant wind and the vibration of the tempestuous sea; upon the
      outer stones the gargoyles poured their noisy waters&mdash;but this&mdash;but
      this was Paradise!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The explanation must be mine,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was prying upon no amour, but
      seeking to confirm some vague alarms and suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were, perhaps, connected with my father,&rdquo; she said, with a
      divination that Count Victor had occasion to remember again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father!&rdquo; he exclaimed, astonished that one more of his
      misconceptions should be thus dispelled. &ldquo;Then I have been guilty of the
      unpardonable liberty of spying upon my hostess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A droll hostess, I must say, and I am the black-affronted woman,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;but through no fault of mine. I am in my own good father's house,
      and still, in a way, a stranger in it, and that is a hard thing. But you
      must not distrust my father: you will find, I think, before very long,
      that all the odd affairs in this house have less to do with him than with
      his daughter Olivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed again as she introduced her name, but with a sensitiveness
      that Count Victor found perfectly entrancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, wishing the while he had had a <i>friseur</i>
      at the making of his toilet that morning, as he ran his fingers over his
      beard and the thick brown hair that slightly curled above his brow,&mdash;&ldquo;my
      dear mademoiselle, I feel pestilently like a fool and a knave to have
      placed myself in this position in any way to your annoyance. I hope I may
      have the opportunity before I leave Doom of proffering an adequate
      apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He expected her to leave him then, and he had a foot retired, preparing to
      re-enter his room, but there was a hesitancy in her manner that told him
      she had something more to say. She bit her nether lip&mdash;the orchards
      of Cammercy, he told himself, never bred a cherry a thousandth part so
      rich and so inviting, even to look at in candle-light; a shy dubiety
      hovered round her eyes. He waited her pleasure to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said she softly, relinquishing her brave demeanour&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
      it might be well that&mdash;that my father knew nothing of this meeting,
      or&mdash;or&mdash;or of what led to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Olivia,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;I am&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;a
      somnambulist. In that condition it has sometimes been my so good fortune
      to wander into the most odd and ravishing situations. But as it happens,
      <i>helas!</i> I can never recall a single incident of them when I waken in
      the morning. <i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; (he remembered that even yet his suspicions
      of the Baron were unsatisfied), &ldquo;I would with some pleasure become a
      nocturnal conspirator myself, and I have all the necessary qualities&mdash;romance,
      enterprise, and sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mungo knows all,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;Mungo will explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With infinite deference, mademoiselle, Mungo shall not be invited to do
      anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must,&rdquo; said she firmly. &ldquo;It is due to myself, as well as to you,
      and I shall tell him to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your good taste and judgment, mademoiselle, are your instructors. Permit
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the candlestick from her hands, gravely led the way to her chamber
      door, and at the threshold restored the light with an excess of polite
      posturing not without its whimsicality. As she took the candlestick she
      looked in his face with a twinkle of amusement in her eyes, giving her a
      vivacity not hitherto betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guessing but half the occasion of her smiles, he cried abruptly, and not
      without confusion: &ldquo;Ah! you were the amused observer of my farce in wading
      across from the shore. <i>Peste!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed and I was!&rdquo; said she, smiling all the more brightly at the scene
      recalled. &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, more of a rogue than Count Victor had thought her, she disappeared
      into her chamber, leaving him to find his way back to his own.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV &mdash; A RAY OF LIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the remainder of the night Count Victor's sleep was delicious or
      disturbed by dreams in which the gloomy habitation of that strange
      Highland country was lit with lamps&mdash;the brightest a woman's eyes.
      Sometimes she was Cecile, dancing&mdash;all abandoned, a child of
      dalliance, a nymph irresolute&mdash;to the music of a flageolet; sometimes
      another whose radiance fascinated, whose presence yet had terror, for (in
      the manner of dreams that at their maddest have some far-compassing and
      tremendous philosophy such as in the waking world is found in poems) she
      was more than herself, she was the other also, at least sharing the
      secrets of that great sisterhood of immaculate and despoiled, and, looking
      in his face, compelled to see his utter unworthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose early and walked in the narrow garden, still sodden with rain,
      though a bold, warm sun shone high to the east. For ordinary he was not
      changeable, but an Olivia in Doom made a difference: those mouldering
      walls contained her; she looked out on the sea from those high peering
      windows; that bower would sometimes shelter her; those alien breezes
      flowing continually round Doom were privileged to kiss her hair.
      Positively there seems no great reason, after all, why he should be so
      precipitate in his removal to the town! Indeed (he told himself with the
      smile of his subconscious self at the subterfuge) there was a risk of
      miscarriage for his mission among tattling <i>aubergistes</i>, lawyers,
      and merchants. He was positively vexed when he encountered Mungo, and that
      functionary informed him that, though he was early afoot, the Baron was
      earlier still, and off to the burgh to arrange for his new lodgings. This
      precipitancy seemed unpleasantly like haste to be rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he to the little servant, &ldquo;your master is so good, so kind, so
      attentive. Yet I do not wonder, for your Highland hospitality is renowned.
      I have heard much of it from the dear exiles&mdash;Glengarry <i>par
      exemple</i>, when he desired to borrow the cost of a litre or the price of
      the diligence to Dun-querque in the season when new-come Scots were
      reaching there in a humour to be fleeced by a compatriot with three
      languages at command and the boast of connections with Versailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo quite comprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, with some feeling, &ldquo;there was never bed nor board grudged
      at Doom. It's like father like son a' through them. The Baron's
      great-gutcher, auld Alan, ance thought the place no' braw enough for the
      eye o' a grand pairty o' Irish nobeelity that had bidden themsel's to see
      him, and the day they were to come he burned the place hauf doon. It was
      grand summer weather, and he camped them i' the park behin' there, sparing
      time nor money nor device in their entertainment. Ye see what might hae
      been a kin' o' penury in a castle was the very extravagance o' luxury in a
      camp. A hole in the hose is an accident nae gentleman need be ashamed o',
      but the same darned is a disgrace, bein' poverty confessed, as Annapla
      says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a touchy servant this, Montaiglon told himself&mdash;somewhat
      sharper, too, than he had thought: he must hazard no unkind ironies upon
      the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming, charming! good Mungo,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The expedient might have been
      devised by my own great-grandfather&mdash;a gentleman of&mdash;of&mdash;of
      commercial pursuits in Lyons city. I am less fastidious, perhaps, than the
      Irish, being very glad to take Doom Castle as I have the honour to find
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ye're thinkin' the Baron is in a hurry to billet ye elsewhere,&rdquo; said
      the servant bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an ordinary lackey this boldness would have been too much for Count
      Victor; in this grotesque, so much in love, it seemed, with his employer,
      and so much his familiar and friend in a ridiculous Scots fashion, the
      impertinence appeared pardonable. Besides, he blamed himself for the
      ill-breeding of his own irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, if I may be permitted to point it out, is not for us to consider,
      Monsieur Mungo,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have placed myself unreservedly in the
      Baron's hands, and if he considers it good for my indifferent health that
      I should change the air and take up my residence a little farther along
      your delightful coast while my business as a wine merchant from Bordeaux
      is marching, I have no doubt he has reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile he made no effort to conceal stole over Mungo's visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine merchant frae Bordeaux!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I've seen a hantle o' them
      hereaboots at the fish-curin' season, but they cam' in gabbarts to French
      Foreland, and it wasnae usual for them to hae Coont to their names nor
      whingers to their hips. It was mair ordinar the ink-horn at their belts
      and the sporran at their groins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A malediction on the creature's shrewdness!&rdquo; said Count Victor inwardly,
      while outwardly he simply smiled back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The red wine is my specialty,&rdquo; said he, patting his side where the hilt
      of his sword should be. &ldquo;My whinger, as you call it, is an auger: who the
      devil ever broached a pipe of Scots spirits with a penknife? But I see you
      are too much in the confidence of the Baron for there to be any necessity
      of concealment between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; exclaimed Mungo dryly, as one who has a sense of being flattered
      too obviously. &ldquo;The Baron's a bairn, like a' true gentlemen I've seen, and
      he kens me lang enough and likes me weel enough to mak' nae secret o' what
      it were to a'body's advantage should be nae secret to Mungo Byde. In this
      place I'm sentinel, spy, and garrison; it wad ill become the officer in
      command to let me be doin' my wark withoot some clew to the maist
      important pairt o't. Ye're here on a search for ane Drimdarroch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wizard, Monsieur Mungo!&rdquo; cried Montaiglon, not without chagrin
      at Doom's handing over so vast and vital a secret to a menial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and ye might think it droll that I should ken that; But I be't to ken
      it, for there's mony a plot against my maister, and nae foreigneer comes
      inside thae wa's whase pedigree I canna' hae an inklin' o'. Ye're here
      aifter Drimdarroch, and ye're no' very sure aboot your host, and that's
      the last thing I wad haggle wi' ye aboot, for your error'll come to ye
      by-and-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor waved a deprecating hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ken a' aboot what mak's ye sae suspicious,&rdquo; went on Mungo,
      undisturbed, &ldquo;and it's a thing I could mak' clear to ye in a
      quarter-hour's crack if I had his leave. Tak' my word for't, there's no' a
      better man wi' his feet in brogues this day than the Baron o' Doom. He
      should be searchin' the warld wi' the sword o' his faithers (and the same
      he can use), but the damned thing is the warld for him doesna gang by the
      snout o' Cowal and the pass o' Glencroe. He had a wife ance; she's dead
      and buried in Kilmorich; noo he's doited on his hame and his dochter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The charming Olivia!&rdquo; cried Count Victor, thinking in one detail at all
      events to surprise this little custodian of all the secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye met her last night,&rdquo; said Mungo, calmly, seeming to enjoy the rapidity
      with which his proofs of omniscience could be put forth. &ldquo;That's half the
      secret. Ye were daunderin' aboot the lobby wi' thae fine French manners I
      hae heard o'&mdash;frae the French theirsels&mdash;and wha' wad blame ye
      in a hoose like this? And ye're early up the day, but the lass was up
      earlier to tell me o' your meeting. She had to come to me before Annapla
      was aboot, for Annapla's no' in this part o' the ploy at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest I have no head for charades,&rdquo; said Count Victor, with a gesture
      of bewilderment. &ldquo;I do not know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo chuckled with huge satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, it's as plain's parridge! There's a gentleman in the toon down by
      that's a hot wooer, and daddy's for nane o' his kind roon' Doom; d'ye tak'
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still&mdash;but still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still the trystin' gaes on, ye were aboot to say. That's very true,
      Coont, but it's only the like o' you and me that has nae dochters to
      plague oorsel's wi' that can guess the like o' that. Ay, it gaes on as ye
      say, and that's where me and Miss Olivia maun put oor trust in you. In
      this affair I'll admit I'm a traitor in the camp&mdash;at least, to the
      camp commander, but I think it's in a guid cause. The lassie's fair aff
      her heid, and nae wonder, for he's a fine mak' o' a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good one, I hope?&rdquo; interjected Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Mungo. &ldquo;I thocht that wasna laid muckle stress on in France.
      He's a takin' deevil, and the kind's but middlin' morally, sae far as I
      had ony experience o' them. Guid or bad, Miss Olivia, nae further gane nor
      last Friday, refused to promise she wad gie up meetin' him&mdash;though
      she's the gem o' dochters, God bless her bonny een! His lordship got up in
      a tirravee and ordered her to her room, wi' Annapla for warder, till he
      should mak' arrangements for sending her to his guid-sister's in the low
      country. Your comin' found us in a kin' o' confusion, but ye might hac
      spared yersel' my trepannin' in the tolbooth upstairs, and met her in a
      mair becomin' way at her faither's table if it hadna been for Annapla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Annapla?&rdquo; repeated Montaiglon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah! Annapla has the Gift, ye ken. Dae ye think I wad hae been sae
      ceevil the ither nicht to her when she was yelping on the stair-heid if it
      hadna been her repute for the Evil E'e? Ye may lauch, but I could tell
      tales o' Annapla's capacity. The night afore ye cam' she yoked himsel' on
      his jyling the lassie, though she's the last that wad thraw him. 'Oh.'
      said he, 'ye're a' tarred wi' the ae stick: if ye connive at his comin'
      here without my kennin', I'll gie him death wi' his boots on!' It was in
      the Gaelic this, ye maun ken; Annapla gied me't efter. 'Boots here, boots
      there,' quo' she, 'love's the fine adventurer, and I see by the <i>griosach</i>'
      (that's the fire-embers, ye ken; between the ash o' a peat and the creesh
      o' a candle thae kin' o' witches can tell ye things frae noo to Hogmanay)&mdash;'
      I see by the <i>griosach</i>,' says she, 'that this ane'll come wi' his
      bare feet.' It staggered him; oh, ay! it staggered him a bit. 'Barefit or
      brogues,' said he, 'she'll see no man from this till the day she gaes!'
      And he's the man to keep his word; but it looks as though we might shuffle
      the pack noo and start a new game, for the plans o' flittin' her to
      Dunbarton hae fallen through, I hear, and he'll hae to produce her before
      ye leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in no hurry,&rdquo; said Count Victor, coolly twisting his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! To hae her produced?&rdquo; said the little man, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Farceur!</i> No, to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed is that sae?&rdquo; asked Mungo, in a quite new tone, and reddening.
      &ldquo;H'm! Ye may hae come barefit, but the ither ane has the preference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has my sincere felicitations, I assure you,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;and I
      can only hope he is worthy of the honour of Master Mungo's connivance and
      the lady's devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>he's</i> a' richt! It's only a whim o' Doom's that mak's him
      discoontenance the fellow. I'll allow the gentleman has a name for
      gallantry and debt, and a wheen mair genteel vices that's neither here nor
      there, but he's a pretty lad. He's the man for my fancy&mdash;six feet
      tall, a back like a board, and an e'e like lightning. And he's nane the
      waur o' ha'in' a great interest in Mungo Byde's storie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly a diplomatist!&rdquo; said Count Victor, laughing. &ldquo;I always loved an
      enthusiast; go on&mdash;go on, good Mungo. And so he is my nocturnal owl,
      my flautist of the bower, my Orpheus of the mountains. Does the gifted
      Annapla also connive, and are hers the window signals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annapla kens naething o' that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the Second Sight appears to have its
      limitations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least if it does she's nane the less willin' to be an unconscious aid,
      and put a flag at the window at the biddin' o' Olivia to keep the witches
      awa'. The same flag that keeps aff a witch may easily fetch a bogle.
      There's but ae time noo and then when it's safe for the lad to venture
      frae the mainland, and for that there maun be a signal o' some kind,
      otherwise, if I ken his spirit, he wad never be aff this rock. I'm tellin'
      ye a' that by Mistress Olivia's command, and noo ye're in the plot like
      the lave of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo heaved a deep breath as if relieved of a burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still&mdash;still,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;one hesitates to mention it to so
      excellent a custodian of the family reputation&mdash;still there are other
      things to me somewhat&mdash;somewhat crepuscular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His deprecatory smile and the gesture of his hands and shoulders conveyed
      his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye're thinkin' o' the Baron in tartan,&rdquo; said Mungo, bluntly. He smiled
      oddly. &ldquo;That's the funniest bit of all. If ye're here a while langer
      that'll be plain to ye too. Between the darkest secrets and oor
      understanding o' them there's whiles but a rag, and that minds me that
      Mistress Olivia was behin' the arras tapestry chitterin' wi' fright when
      ye broke in by her window. Sirs! sirs! what times we're ha'in; there's
      ploy in the warld yet, and me unable&mdash;tuts! I'm no' that auld either.
      And faith here's himsel'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo punctiliously saluted his master as that gentleman emerged beneath
      the frowning doorway and joined Count Victor in the dejected garden,
      lifted the faggot of firewood he had laid at his feet during his talk with
      the visitor, and sought his kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Doom's aspect there was restraint: Count Victor shared the feeling, for
      now he realised that, in some respects, at all events, he had been doing
      an injustice to his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find, M. le Count,&rdquo; said Doom, after some trivial introductories, &ldquo;that
      you cannot be accommodated in the inn down by for some days yet&mdash;possibly
      another week. The Circuit Court has left a pack of the legal gentlemen and
      jurymen there, who will not be persuaded to return to Edinburgh so long as
      the cellar at the inn holds out, and my doer, Mr. Petullo, expresses a
      difficulty in getting any other lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret exceedingly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No regret at all, M. le Count,&rdquo; said Doom, &ldquo;no regret at all, unless it
      be that you must put up with a while longer of a house that must be very
      dull to you. It is my privilege and pleasure to have you here&mdash;without
      prejudice to your mission&mdash;and the only difficulty there might be
      about it has been removed through&mdash;through&mdash;through your meeting
      with my daughter Olivia. I learn you met her on the stair last night. Well&mdash;it
      would look droll, I dare say, to have encountered that way, and no word of
      her existence from me, but&mdash;but&mdash;but there has been a little
      disagreement between us. I hope I am a decently indulgent father, M. le
      Count, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see before you one with great shame of his awkwardness, Baron,&rdquo; said
      Montaiglon. &ldquo;Ordinarily, I should respect a host's privacy to the extent
      that I should walk a hundred miles round rather than stumble upon it, but
      this time I do not know whether to blame myself for my gaucherie or feel
      pleased that for once it brought me into good company. Mungo has just
      hinted with his customary discretion at the cause of the mystery. I
      sympathise with the father; I am, with the daughter, <i>très charmé</i>
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This hint of the gallant slightly ruffled Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chut!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The man with an only daughter had need be a man of
      patience. I have done my best with this Olivia of mine. She lost her
      mother when a child&rdquo;&mdash;an accent of infinite tenderness here came to
      his voice. &ldquo;These woods and this shore and this lonely barn of ours, all
      robbed of what once made it a palace to me and mine, were, I fancied,
      uncongenial to her spirit, and I sent her to the Lowlands. She came back,
      educated, as they call it&mdash;I think she brought back as good a heart
      as she took away, but singularly little tolerance sometimes for the life
      in the castle of Doom. It has been always the town for her these six
      months, always the town, for there she fell in with a fellow who is no
      fancy of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor listened sympathetically, somewhat envying the lover,
      reviving in his mental vision the figure he had seen first twelve hours
      ago or less. He was brought to a more vivid interest in the story by the
      altered tone of Doom, who seemed to sour at the very mention of the
      unwelcome cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it's the failing of the sex&mdash;the very best of
      them, because the simplest and the sweetest&mdash;that they will prefer a
      fool to a wise man and a rogue to a gentleman. They're blind, because the
      rogue is for ever showing off his sham good qualities till they shine
      better than an ordinary decent man's may. To my eyes, if not quite to my
      knowledge, this man is as great a scoundrel as was ever left unhung. It's
      in his look&mdash;well, scarcely so, to tell the truth, but something of
      it is in his mouth as well as in his history, and sooner than see my
      daughter take up for life with a creature of his stamp I would have her in
      her grave beside her mother. Unluckily, as I say, the man's a plausible
      rogue: that's the most dangerous rogue of all, and the girl's blind to all
      but the virtues and graces he makes a display of. I'll forgive Petullo his
      cheatry in the common way of his craft sooner than his introduction of
      such a man to my girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all this Count Victor could no more than murmur his sympathy, but he
      had enough of the young gallant in him to make some mental reservations in
      favour of the persistent wooer. It was an alluring type, this haunter of
      the midnight bower, and melancholy sweet breather in the classic reed. All
      the wooers of only daughters, he reminded himself, as well as all the
      sweethearts of only sons, were unworthy in the eyes of parents, and
      probably Mungo's unprejudiced attitude towards the conspiring lovers was
      quite justified by the wooer's real character in spite of the ill repute
      of his history. He reflected that this confidence of Doom's left
      unexplained his own masquerade of the previous night, but he gave no
      whisper to the thought, and had, indeed, forgotten it by evening, when for
      the first time Olivia joined them at her father's table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI &mdash; OLIVIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a trying position in which Olivia found herself when first she sat
      at the same table with the stranger whose sense of humour, as she must
      always think, was bound to be vastly entertained by her ridiculous story.
      Yet she carried off the situation with that triumph that ever awaits on a
      frank eye, a good honest heart, and an unfailing trust in the ultimate
      sympathy of one's fellow-creatures. There was no <i>mauvaise honte</i>
      there, Count Victor saw, and more than ever he admired, if that were
      possible. It was the cruel father of the piece who was uneasy. He it was
      who must busy himself with the feeding of an appetite whose like he had
      not manifested before, either silent altogether or joining in the
      conversation with the briefest sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was never a Montaiglon who would lose such a good occasion, and
      Count Victor made the most of it. He was gentle, but not too gentle&mdash;for
      this was a lady to resent the easy self-effacement with which so many of
      her sex are deceived and flattered; he was not unmindful of the more
      honest compliments, yet he had the shrewdness to eschew the mere
      meaningless <i>blague</i> that no one could better employ with the
      creatures of Versailles, who liked their olives well oiled, or the
      Jeannetons and Mimis of the Italian comedy and the playhouse. Under his
      genial and shining influence Olivia soon forgot the ignominy of these
      recent days, and it was something gained in that direction that already
      she looked upon him as a confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you like our country, Count Victor,&rdquo; she said, no way
      dubious about his praise of her home hills, those loud impetuous
      cataracts, and that alluring coast. &ldquo;It rains&mdash;oh! it rains&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parfaitement</i>, mademoiselle, but when it shines!&rdquo; and up went his
      hands in an admiration wherefor words were too little eloquent: at that
      moment he was convinced truly that the sun shone nowhere else than in the
      Scottish hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, when it shines, as you say, it is the dear land! Then the woods&mdash;the
      woods gleam and tremble, I always think, like a girl who has tears in her
      eyes, the tears of gladness. The hills&mdash;let my father tell you of the
      hills, Count Victor; I think he must love them more than he loves his own
      Olivia&mdash;is that not cruel of a man with an only child? He would die,
      I am sure, if he could not be seeing them when he liked. But I cannot be
      considering the hills so beautiful as my own glens, my own little glens,
      that no one, I'll be fancying, is acquainted with to the heart but me and
      the red deer, and maybe a hunter or two. Of course, we have the big glens,
      too, and I would like it if I could show you Shira Glen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best of it was once our own,&rdquo; said Doom, black at brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;That once was ours, as father says, and is mine yet so long as I
      can walk there and be thinking my own thoughts in it when the wood is
      green, and the wild ducks are plashing in the lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom gave a significant exclamation: he was recalling that rumour had
      Shira Glen for his daughter's favourite trysting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain or shine,&rdquo; said Count Victor, delighting in such whole-souled
      rapture, delighting in that bright, unwearied eye, that curious turn of
      phrase that made her in English half a foreigner like himself&mdash;&ldquo;Rain
      or shine, it is a country of many charms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now you are too large in your praise,&rdquo; she said, not quite so warmly.
      &ldquo;I do not expect you to think it is a perfect country-side at any time and
      all times; and it is but natural that you should love the country of
      France, that I have been told is a brave and beautiful country, and a
      country I am sometimes loving myself because of its hospitality to folk
      that we know. I know it is a country of brave men, and sometimes I am
      wondering if it is the same for beautiful women. Tell me!&rdquo; and she leaned
      on an arm that shone warm, soft, and thrilling from the short sleeve of
      her gown, and put the sweetest of chins upon a hand for the wringing of
      hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon looked into those eyes, so frank and yet profound, and straight
      became a rebel. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Olivia,&rdquo; said he, indifferently (oh, Cecile!
      oh, Cecile!), &ldquo;they are considered not unpleasing; but for myself, perhaps
      acquaintance has spoiled the illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not like that at all; her eyes grew proud and unbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was speaking of the brave men of France,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I fancied
      perhaps they would tell what they really thought&mdash;even to a woman.&rdquo;
       And he felt very much ashamed of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! well, to tell the truth, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;I have known
      very beautiful ones among them, and many that I liked, and still must
      think of with affection. <i>Mort de ma vie!</i> am I not the very slave of
      your sex, that for all the charms, the goodness, the kindnesses and
      purities, is a continual reproach to mine? In the least perfect of them I
      have never failed to find something to remind me of my little mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I think that is much better,&rdquo; said Olivia, heartily, her eyes
      sparkling at that concluding filial note. &ldquo;I would not care at all for a
      man to come from his own land and pretend to me that he had no mind for
      the beautiful women and the good women he had seen there. No; it would not
      deceive me, that; it would not give me any pleasure. We have a proverb in
      the Highlands, that Annapla will often be saying, that the rook thinks the
      pigeon hen would be bonny if her wings were black; and that is a <i>seanfhacal</i>&mdash;that
      is an old-word that is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I seemed to forget France and what I have seen there of Youth and
      Beauty,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;it is, I swear it is&mdash;it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you would be pleasant to a simple Highland girl,&rdquo; said
      Olivia, with just a hint of laughter in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, <i>par ma foi!</i> not wholly that. But yes, I love my country&mdash;ah!
      the happy days I have known there, the sunny weather, the friends so good,
      the comradeship so true. Your land is beautiful&mdash;it is even more
      beautiful than the exiles in Paris told me; but I was not born here, and
      there are times when your mountains seem to crush my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so, indeed?&rdquo; said Doom. &ldquo;As for me, I would not change the bleakest
      of them for the province of Champagne.&rdquo; And he beat an impulsive hand upon
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand that,&rdquo; cried Olivia. &ldquo;I understand it very well.
      It is the sorrow of the hills and woods you mean; ah! do I not know it,
      too? It is only in my own little wee glens among the rowans that I can
      feel careless like the birds, and sing; when I walk the woods or stand
      upon the shore and see the hills without a tree or tenant, when the land
      is white with the snow and the mist is trailing, Olivia Lamond is not very
      cheery. What it is I do not know&mdash;that influence of my country; it is
      sad, but it is good and wholesome, I can tell you; it is then I think that
      the bards make songs, and those who are not bards, like poor myself, must
      just be feeling the songs there are no words for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this did Doom sit mighty pleased and humming to himself a bar of
      minstrelsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my father there!&rdquo; said Olivia; &ldquo;he would like you to be thinking
      that he does not care a great deal for the Highlands of Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and that is not fair, Olivia; I never made pretence of that,&rdquo;
       said Doom. &ldquo;Never to such as understand; Montaiglon knows the Highlands
      are at my heart, and that the look of the hills is my evening prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that a father, Count Victor?&rdquo; cried Olivia, quite proud of the
      confession. &ldquo;But he is the strange father, too, that will be pretending
      that he has forgotten the old times and the old customs of our dear
      people. We are the children of the hills and of the mists; the hills make
      no change, the mists are always coming back, and the deer is in the corrie
      yet, and when you will hear one that is of the Highland blood say he does
      not care any more for the old times, and preferring the English tongue to
      his own, and making a boast of his patience when the Government of England
      robs him of his plaid, you must be watchful of that man, Count Victor. For
      there is something wrong. Is it not true, that I am saying, father?&rdquo; She
      turned a questioning gaze to Doom, who had no answer but a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have perhaps heard my father miscall the <i>breacan</i>, miscall
      the tartan, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; cried the Baron. &ldquo;There is a great difference between
      condemning and showing an indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, father,&rdquo; said Olivia, &ldquo;we are among friends. Count Victor, as
      you say, could understand about our fancies for the hills, and it would be
      droll indeed if he smiled at us for making a treasure of the tartan.
      Whatever my father, the stupid man, the darling, may be telling you of the
      tartan and the sword, Count Victor, do not believe that we are such poor
      souls as to forget them. Though we must be wearing the Saxon in our
      clothes and in our speech, there are many like me&mdash;and my dear father
      there&mdash;who will not forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious speech all that, not without a problem, as well as the
      charm of the unexpected and the novel, to Count Victor. For, somehow or
      other, there seemed to be an under meaning in the words; Olivia was
      engaged upon the womanly task&mdash;he thought&mdash;of lecturing some
      one. If he had any doubt about that, there was Mungo behind the Baron's
      chair, his face just showing over his shoulder, seamed with smiles that
      spoke of some common understanding between him and the daughter of his
      master; and once, when she thrust more directly at her father, the little
      servitor deliberately winked to the back of his master's head&mdash;a very
      gnome of slyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not told me about the ladies of France,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Stay!
      you will be telling me that again; it is not likely my father would be
      caring to hear about them so much as about the folk we know that have gone
      there from Scotland. They are telling me that many good, brave men are
      there wearing their hearts out, and that is the sore enough trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor thought of Barisdale and his cousin-german, young Glengarry,
      gambling in that frowsiest boozing-ken in the Rue Tarane&mdash;the Café de
      la Paix&mdash;without credit for a <i>louis d'or</i>; he thought of James
      Mor Drummond and the day he came to him behind the Tuileries stable clad
      in rags of tartan to beg a loan; none of these was the picturesque figure
      of loyalty in exile that he should care to paint for this young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remembered also Cameron, Macleod, Traquair, a score of gallant
      hearts, of handsome gentlemen, and Lochiel, true chevalier&mdash;perhaps a
      better than his king!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of these Count Victor spoke&mdash;of their faith, their valiancies,
      their shifts of penury and pride. He had used often to consort with them
      at Cammercy, and later on in Paris. If the truth were to be told, they had
      made a man of him, and now he was generous enough to confess it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe them much, your exiles, Mademoiselle Olivia,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When first
      I met with them I was a man without an ideal or a name, without a scrap of
      faith or a cause to quarrel for. It is not good for the young, that,
      Baron, is it? To be passing the days in an <i>ennui</i> and the nights
      below the lamps? Well, I met your Scots after Dettingen, renewed the old
      acquaintance I had made at Cam-mercy, and found the later exiles better
      than the first&mdash;than the Balhaldies, the Glengarries, Mur-rays, and
      Sullivans. They were different, <i>ces gens-là</i>. Ordinarily they
      rendezvoused in the Taverne Tourtel of St. Germains, and that gloomy
      palace shared their devotions with Scotland, whence they came and of which
      they were eternally talking, like men in a nostalgia. James and his
      Jacquette were within these walls, often indifferent enough, I fear, about
      the cause our friends were exiled there for; and Charles, between
      Luneville and Liege or Poland and London, was not at the time an inspiring
      object of veneration, if you will permit me to says so, M. le Baron. But
      what does it matter? the cause was there, an image to keep the good hearts
      strong, unselfish, and expectant. Ah! the songs they sang, so full of that
      hopeful melancholy of the glens you speak of, mademoiselle; the stories
      they told of Tearlach's Year; the hopes that bound them in a brotherhood&mdash;and
      binds them yet, praise <i>le bon Dieu!</i> That was good for me. Yes; I
      like your exiled compatriots very much, Mademoiselle Olivia. And yet there
      was a <i>maraud</i> or two among them; no fate could be too hard for the
      spies who would betray them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in many hours Count Victor remembered that he had an
      object in Scotland, but with it somehow Cecile was not associated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mungo has been telling me about the spy, Count Victor. Oh, the wickedness
      of it! I feel black, burning shame that one with a Highland name and a
      Highland mother would take a part like yon. I would not think there could
      be men in the world so bad. They must have wicked mothers to make such
      sons; the ghost of a good mother would cry from her grave to check her
      child in such a villany.&rdquo; Olivia spoke with intense feeling, her eyes
      lambent and her lips quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drimdarroch's mother must have been a rock,&rdquo; said Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to take what was my father's name!&rdquo; cried Olivia; &ldquo;Mungo has been
      telling me that. Though I am a woman, I could be killing him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here we're in our flights, sure enough!&rdquo; broke in the father, as he
      left them with a humorousous pretence at terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must tell me about the women of France,&rdquo; said Olivia. &ldquo;I have a
      friend who was there once, and tells me, like you, he was indifferent; but
      I am doubting that he must have seen some there that were worth his
      fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it there sits the wind?&rdquo; thought Montaiglon. &ldquo;Our serene angel is not
      immune against the customary passions.&rdquo; An unreasonable envy of the
      diplomatist who had been indifferent to the ladies of France took
      possession of him; still, he might have gratified her curiosity about his
      fair compatriots had not Doom returned, and then Olivia's interest in the
      subject oddly ceased.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII &mdash; A SENTIMENTAL SECRET
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Olivia, at last, and straightway Count Victor felt the
      glory of the evening eclipse. He opened the door to let her pass through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go back to my cell quiet enough,&rdquo; she said, in low tones, and with a
      smiling frown upon her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy prisoner!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to be condemned to no worse than your own
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is often a very dull and pitiful company that, Count Victor,&rdquo; said
      Olivia, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long till he, too, sought his couch, and the Baron of Doom was
      left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom sat long looking at his crumbling walls, and the flaming fortunes,
      the blush, the heat-white and the dead grey ash of the peat-fire. He
      sighed now and then with infinite despondency. Once or twice he pshawed
      his melancholy vapours, gave a pace back and forward on the oaken floor,
      with a bent head, a bereaved countenance, and sat down again, indulging in
      the passionate void that comes to a bosom reft of its joys, its hopes and
      loves, and only mournful recollection left. A done man! Not an old man;
      not even an elderly, but a done man none the less, with the heart out of
      him, and all the inspiration clean gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor's advent in the castle had brought its own bitterness, for it
      was not often now that Doom had the chance to see anything of the big,
      brave outer world of heat and enterprise. This gallant revived
      ungovernably the remembrances he for ever sought to stifle&mdash;all he
      had been and all he had seen, now past and gone for ever, as Annapla did
      not scruple to tell him when the demands of her Gift or a short temper
      compelled her. His boyhood in the dear woods, by the weedy river-banks, in
      the hill-clefts where stags harboured, on a shore for ever sounding with
      the enchanting sea&mdash;oh, sorrow! how these things came before him. The
      gentle mother, with the wan, beautiful face; the eager father looking
      ardent out to sea&mdash;they were plain to view. And then St. Andrews,
      when he was a bejant of St. Leonard's, roystering with his fellows, living
      the life of youth with gusto, but failing lamentably at the end; then the
      despondency of those scanty acres and decayed walls; his marriage with the
      dearest woman in the world, Death at the fireside, the bairn crying at
      night in the arms of her fosterer; his journeys abroad, the short hour of
      glory and forgetfulness with Saxe at Fontenoy and Laffeldt, to be followed
      only by these weary years of spoliation by law, of oppression by the
      usurping Hanoverian.
    </p>
    <p>
      A done man! Only a poor done man of middle age, and the fact made all the
      plainer to himself by contrast with his guest, alert and even gay upon a
      fiery embassy of retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly the hour of midnight by a clock upon the mantel; a single
      candle, by which he had made a show of reading, was guttering all to a
      side and an ungracious end in a draught that came from some cranny in the
      ill-seamed ingle-walls, for all that the night seemed windless. A profound
      stillness wrapped all; the night was huge outside, with the sea dead-flat
      to moon and pulsing star.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook off his vapours vexatiously, and, as he had done on the first
      night of Count Victor's coming, he went to his curious orisons at the door&mdash;the
      orisons of the sentimentalist, the home-lover. Back he drew the bars
      softly, and looked at the world that ever filled him with yearning and
      apprehension, at the draggled garden, at the sea, with its roadway strewn
      with golden sand all shimmering, at the mounts&mdash;Ben Ime, Ardno, and
      Ben Artair, haughty in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he shut the doors reluctantly, stood hesitating&mdash;more the done
      man than ever&mdash;in the darkness of the entrance, finally hurried to
      save the guttering candle. He lit a new one at its expiring flame and left
      the <i>salle</i>. He went, not to his bedchamber, but to the foot of the
      stair that led to the upper flats, to his daughter's room, to the room of
      his guest, and to the ancient chapel. With infinite caution, he crept
      round and round on the narrow corkscrew stair; at any step it might have
      been a catacomb cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened at the narrow corridor leading to Olivia's room and that
      adjoining of her umquhile warder, Annapla; he paused, too, for a second,
      at Montaiglon's door. None gave sign of life. He went up higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      A storey over the stage on which Count Victor slumbered the stair ended
      abruptly at an oaken door, which he opened with a key. As he entered, a
      wild flurry of wings disturbed the interior, and by the light of the
      candle and some venturesome rays of the moon a flock of bats or birds were
      to be seen in precipitous flight through unglazed windows and a broken
      roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom placed his candle in a niche of the wall and went over to an ancient
      <i>armoire</i>, or chest, which seemed to be the only furniture of what
      had apparently once been the chapel of the castle, to judge from its size
      and the situation of an altar-like structure at the east end-.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the heavy lid, threw it open, looked down with a sigh at its
      contents, which seemed, in the light of he candle, nothing wonderful. But
      a suit of Highland clothes, and some of the more martial appurtenances of
      the lost Highland state, including the dirk that had roused Montaiglon's
      suspicion!
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew them out hurriedly upon the floor, but yet with an affectionate
      tenderness, as if they were the relics of a sacristy, and with eagerness
      substituted the gay tartan for his dull mulberry Saxon habiliments. It was
      like the creation of a man from a lay figure. The jerk at the kilt-belt
      buckle somehow seemed to brace the sluggish spirit; his shoulders found
      their old square set above a well-curved back; his feet&mdash;his knees&mdash;by
      an instinct took a graceful poise they had never learned in the mean
      immersement of breeches and Linlithgow boots. As he fastened his buckled
      brogues, he hummed the words of MacMhaister Allister's songs:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh! the black-cloth of the Saxon,
     Dearer far's the Gaelic tartan!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh Bethune's content with the waistcoat, is he?&rdquo; he said to himself.
      &ldquo;He's no Gael to be so easily pleased, and him with a freeman's liberty!
      And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I would be content myself to have the old
      stuff only about my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assumed the doublet and plaid, drew down upon his brow a bonnet with an
      eagle plume; turned him to the weapons. The knife&mdash;the pistols&mdash;the
      dirk, went to their places, and last he put his hand upon the hilt of a
      sword&mdash;not a claymore, but the weapon he had worn in the foreign
      field. As foolish a piece of masquerade as ever a child had found
      entertainment in, and yet, if one could see it, with some great element of
      pathos and of dignity. For with every item of the discarded and degraded
      costume of his race he seemed to put on a grace not there before, a
      manliness, a spirit that had lain in abeyance with the clothes in that
      mothy chest. It was no done man who eagerly trod the floor of that ruined
      chapel, no lack-lustre failure of life, but one complete, commingling
      action with his sentiment. He felt the world spacious about him again; a
      summons to ample fields beyond the rotting woods and the sonorous shore of
      Doom. The blood of his folk, that had somehow seemed to stay about his
      heart in indolent clots, began to course to every extremity, and gave his
      brain a tingling clarity, a wholesome intoxication of the perfect man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the sword from its scabbard, joying hugely in the lisp of the
      steel, at its gleam in the candle-light, and he felt anew the wonder of
      one who had drunk the wine of life and venture to its lees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made with the weapon an airy academic salute <i>à la Gerard</i> and the
      new school of fence, thrust swift in tierce like a sun-flash in forest
      after rain, followed with a parade, and felt an expert's ecstasy. The
      blood tingled to his veins; his eyes grew large and flashing; a flush came
      to that cheek, for ordinary so wan. Over and over again he sheathed the
      sword, and as often withdrew it from its scabbard. Then he handled the
      dirk with the pleasure of a child. But always back to the sword, handled
      with beauty and aplomb, always back to the sword, and he had it before
      him, a beam of fatal light, when something startled him, as one struck
      unexpectedly by a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a furious rapping at the outer door!
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII &mdash; &ldquo;Loch Sloy!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The rap that startled Doom in the midst of his masquerade in the chapel of
      his house, came like the morning beat of drums to his guest a storey
      lower. Count Victor sprang up with a certainty that trouble brew, dressed
      with all speed, and yet with the coolness of one who has heard alarums on
      menaced frontiers; took his sword in hand, hesitated, remembered Olivia,
      and laid it down again; then descended the dark stair that seemed the very
      pit of hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      A perturbing silence had succeeded the noisy summons on the oak, and
      Mungo, with a bold aspect well essayed, but in no accord with the tremour
      of his knees and the pallor of his countenance, stood, in dragging
      pantaloons and the gaudy Kilmarnock cap cocked upon his bald head, at the
      stair-foot with a flambeau in his hand. He seemed hugely relieved to have
      the company of Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo, wha the deevil can we hae here at sic an unearthly oor o' nicht?&rdquo;
       said he, trying a querulous tone befitting an irate sentinel; but the
      sentence trailed off unconvincingly, because his answer came too promptly
      in another peremptory summons from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord keep 's!&rdquo; whispered the little man, no longer studying to sustain
      his martial <i>rôle</i>. He looked nervously at Count Victor standing
      silently by, with some amusement at the perturbation of the garrison and a
      natural curiosity as to what so untimely a visit might portend. It was
      apparent that Mungo was for once willing to delegate his duty as keeper of
      the bartizan to the first substitute who offered, but here was no move to
      help him out of his quandary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's gey gash this!&rdquo; whispered the little man. &ldquo;And the tide in, too! And
      the oor sae late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These sinister circumstances seemed to pile upon his brain till his knees
      bent below the weight of accumulated terror, and Montaiglon must smile at
      fears not all unreasonable, as he felt himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! better late than never&mdash;is not that the proverb, Master Mungo?&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Though, indeed, it is not particularly consoling to a widow's
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd gie a pound Scots to ken wha chaps,&rdquo; said Mungo, deaf to every
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I suggest your asking? It is, I have heard, the customary
      proceeding,&rdquo; said Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha's there?&rdquo; cried Mungo, with an ear to the wood, that appeared to have
      nothing human outside, for now for a little there was absolute stillness.
      Then an answer as from a wraith&mdash;the humble request of some one for
      admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo, that's michty droll,&rdquo; said Mungo, his face losing its alarm and
      taking on a look of some astonishment. &ldquo;Haud that,&rdquo; and he thrust the
      torch in the Frenchman's hand. Without another word he drew back the bars,
      opened the door, and put out his head. He was caught by the throat and
      plucked forth into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor could not have drawn a weapon had he had one ere the door
      fell in thundering on the walls. He got one glimpse of the <i>sans
      culottes</i>, appealed again to the De Chenier macer in his ancestry, and
      flung the flambeau at the first who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light went out; he dropped at a boy's intuition upon a knee and
      lowered his head. Over him in the darkness poured his assailants, too
      close upon each other in their eagerness, and while they struggled at the
      stair-foot he drew softly back. Out in the night Mungo wailed lugubrious
      in the hands of some of his captors; within there was a wonderful silence
      for a little, the baffled visitors recovering themselves with no waste of
      words, and mounting the stair in pursuit of the gentleman they presumed to
      have preceded them. When they were well up, he went to the door and made
      it fast again, leaving Mungo to the fate his stupidity deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom's sleeping-chamber lay behind; he passed along the corridor quickly,
      knocked at the door, got no answer, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as he had fancied&mdash;his host was gone, his couch had not been
      occupied. A storm of passion swept through him; he felt himself that
      contemptible thing, a man of the world betrayed by a wickedness that ought
      to be transparent. They were in the plot then, master and man, perhaps
      even&mdash;but no, that was a thought to quell on the moment of its
      waking; she at least was innocent of all these machinations, and upstairs
      now, she shared, without a doubt, the alarms of Annapla. That familiar of
      shades and witches, that student of the fates, was a noisy poltroon when
      it was the material world that threatened; she was shrieking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loch Sloy! Loch Sloy!&rdquo; now rose the voices overhead, surely the maddest
      place in the world for a Gaelic slogan: it gave him a sense of unspeakable
      savagery and antique, for it was two hundred years since his own family
      had cried &ldquo;Cammercy!&rdquo; on stricken fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, irresolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A veritable farce! he thought. It would have been so much easier for his
      host to hand him over without these play-house preliminaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Olivia! but Olivia!
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the good impulse of love and anger, the old ichor of his folk
      surged through his veins, and without a weapon he went upstairs, trusting
      to his wits to deal best with whatever he would there encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed an hour since they had entered; in truth it was but a minute or
      two, and they were still in the bewildering blackness of the stair, one
      behind another in its narrow coils, and seemingly wisely dubious of too
      precipitate an advance. He estimated that they numbered less than half a
      dozen when he came upon the rear-most of the <i>queue</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loch Sloy!&rdquo; cried the leader, somewhat too theatrically for illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cammercy for me!&rdquo; thought Montaiglon: he was upon the tail, and clutched
      to drag the last man down. Fate was kind, she gave the bare knees of the
      enemy to his hand, and behold! here was his instrument&mdash;in the
      customary knife stuck in the man's stocking. It was Count Victor's at a
      flash: he stood a step higher, threw his arm over the shoulder of the man,
      pulled him backward into the pit of the stair and stabbed at him as he
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Un!</i>&rdquo; said he as the wretch collapsed upon himself, and the knife
      seemed now unnecessary. He clutched the second man, who could not guess
      the tragedy behind, for the night's business was all in front, and surely
      only friends were in the rear&mdash;he clutched the second lower, and
      threw him backward over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Deux!</i>&rdquo; said Count Victor, as the man fell limp behind him upon his
      unconscious confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third in front turned like a viper when Count Victor's clutch came on
      his waist, and drove out with his feet. The act was his own undoing. It
      met with no resistance, and the impetus of his kick carried him off the
      balance and threw him on the top of his confederates below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Trois!</i>&rdquo; said Montaiglon. &ldquo;Pulling corks is the most excellent
      training for such a warfare,&rdquo; and he set himself almost cheerfully to
      number four.
    </p>
    <p>
      But number four was not in the neck of the bottle: this ferment behind him
      propelled him out upon the stairhead, and Montaiglon, who had thrown
      himself upon him, fell with him on the floor. Both men recovered their
      feet at a spring. A moment's pause was noisy with the cries of the
      domestic in her room, then the Frenchman felt a hand pass rapidly over his
      habiliments and seek hurriedly for his throat, as on a sudden inspiration.
      What that precluded was too obvious: he fancied he could feel the poignard
      already plunging in his ribs, and he swiftly tried a fall with his
      opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wrestler's grip he sought, but a wrestler he found, for arms of a
      gigantic strength went round him, clasping his own to his side and
      rendering his knife futile; a Gaelic malediction hissed in his ear; he
      felt breath hot and panting; his own failed miserably, and his blood sang
      in his head with the pressure of those tremendous arms that caught him to
      a chest like a cuirass of steel. But if his hands were bound his feet were
      free: he placed one behind his enemy and flung his weight upon him, so
      that they fell together. This time Count Victor was uppermost. His hands
      were free of a sudden; he raised the knife to stab at the breast heaving
      under him, but he heard as from another world&mdash;as from a world of
      calm and angels&mdash;the voice of Olivia in her room crying for her
      father, and a revulsion seized him, so that he hesitated at his ugly task.
      It was less than a second's slackness, yet it was enough, for his enemy
      rolled free and plunged for the stair. Montaiglon seized him as he fled;
      the skirt of his coat dragged through his hands, and left him with a
      button. He dropped it with a cry, and turned in the darkness to find
      himself more frightfully menaced than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the plunge of the dirk was actual; he felt it sear his side like
      a hot iron, and caught the wrist that held it only in time to check a
      second blow. His fingers slipped, his head swam; a moment more, and a
      Montaiglon was dead very far from his pleasant land of France, in a
      phantom castle upon a shadowy sea among savage ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Olivia's voice; a light was thrown upon the scene, for she stood
      beside the combatants with a candle in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew back at a mutual spasm, and Montaiglon saw that his antagonist
      was the Baron of Doom!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX &mdash; REVELATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Doom, astounded, threw the dagger from him with an exclamation. His eyes,
      large and burning yet with passion, were wholly for Count Victor, though
      his daughter Olivia stood there at his side holding the light that had
      revealed the furies to each other, her hair in dark brown cataracts on her
      shoulders, and eddying in bewitching curls upon her ears and temples, that
      gleamed below like the foam of mountain pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! father! what does this mean?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There is some fearful
      mistake here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not to exaggerate the position, at all events,&rdquo; thought Count
      Victor, breathing hard, putting the knife unobserved behind him. He smiled
      to this vision and shrugged his shoulders. He left the elucidation of the
      mystery to the other gentleman, this counsellor of forgiveness and peace,
      clad head to foot in the garb he contemned, and capable of some excellent
      practice with daggers in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never be able to say how much I regret this, Count Victor,&rdquo; said
      Doom. &ldquo;Good God! your hands were going, and in a second or two more&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For so hurried a farce,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;the lowered light was
      something of a mistake, <i>n'est ce pas?</i> I&mdash;I&mdash;I just missed
      the point of the joke,&rdquo; and he glanced at the dagger glittering sinister
      in the corner of the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known your mistake all along,&rdquo; cried Olivia. &ldquo;Oh! it is a stupid
      thing this. I will tell you! It is my father should have told you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clangour of the outer door closing recalled that there was danger
      still below. Olivia put a frightened hand on her father's arm. &ldquo;A thousand
      pardons, Montaiglon,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;but here's a task to finish.&rdquo; And without
      a word more of excuse or explanation he plunged downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor looked dubiously after him, and made no move to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you will not be leaving him alone there,&rdquo; said Olivia. &ldquo;Oh! you
      have not your sword. I will get your sword.&rdquo; And before he could reply she
      had flown to his room. She returned with the weapon. Her hand was all
      trembling as she held it out to him. He took it slowly; there seemed no
      need for haste below now, for all was silent except the voices of Doom and
      Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you, Mademoiselle Olivia,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I thank you, but&mdash;but&mdash;you
      find me in a quandary. Am I to consider M. le Baron as ally or&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
       He hesitated to put the brutal alternative to the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olivia stamped her foot impetuously, her visage disturbed by emotions of
      anxiety, vexation, and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go! go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You will not, surely, be taking my father for a
      traitor to his own house&mdash;for a murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire to make the least of a pleasantry I am incapable of
      comprehending, yet his dagger was uncomfortably close to my ribs a minute
      or two ago,&rdquo; sard Count Victor reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Is not this a coil? I must even go myself,&rdquo; and she made
      to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Count Victor softly, holding her back. &ldquo;Nay, nay; I will
      go if your whole ancestry were ranked at the foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the most stupid thing,&rdquo; she cried, as he left her; &ldquo;I will explain
      when you come up. My father is a Highland gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, by the way, was Drimdarroch,&rdquo; said Montaiglon, but that was to
      himself. He smiled back into the illumination of the lady's candle, then
      descended into the darkness with a brow tense and frowning, and his weapon
      prepared for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stair was vacant, so was the corridor. The outer door was open; the
      sound of the sea came in faint murmurs, the mingled odours of pine and
      wrack borne with it. Out in the heavens a moon swung among her stars most
      queenly and sedate, careless altogether of this mortal world of strife and
      terrors; the sea had a golden roadway. A lantern light bobbed on the outer
      edge of the rock, shining through Olivia's bower like a will-o'-the-wisp,
      and he could hear in low tones the voices of Doom and his servant. Out at
      sea, but invisible, for beyond the moon's influence, a boat was being
      rowed fast: the beat of the oars on the thole-pins came distinctly. And in
      the wood behind, now cut off from them by the riding waves, owls called
      incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a night in a dream, like some vast wheeling chimera of fever&mdash;that
      plangent sea before, those terrors fleeing, and behind, a maiden left with
      her duenna in a castle demoniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom and Mungo came back from the rock edge, silently almost, brooding
      over a mystery, and the three looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are gone,&rdquo; said the Baron at last, showing the way to his
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, gone!&rdquo; said Montaiglon, incapable of restraining his irony. &ldquo;Not
      all of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord! but this is the nicht!&rdquo; cried the little servant who carried the
      lantern. &ldquo;I micht hae bided a' my days in Fife and never kent what war
      was. The only thing that daunts me is that I should hae missed my chance
      o' a whup at them, for they had me trussed like a cock before I put my
      feet below me when they pu'd me oot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew the bars with nervous fingers, and seemed to dread his master as
      much as he had done the enemy. Olivia had come down to the corridor; aloft
      Annapla had renewed her lamentations; the four of them stood clustered in
      the narrow passage at the stair-foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for did ye open the door, Mungo?&rdquo; asked Doom,&mdash;not the Doom of
      doleful days, of melancholy evenings of study and of sour memories, not
      the done man, but one alert and eager, a soldier, in the poise of his
      body, the set of his limbs, the spirit of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a new man!&rdquo; thought Montaiglon, silently regarding him. &ldquo;Devilry
      appears to have a marvellous power of stimulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I opened the door,&rdquo; said Mungo, much perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said Doom shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a knock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it. The knock was obvious; it dirled the very roof of the house.
      But it was not necessary to open at a knock at this time of morning; ye
      must have had a reason. Hospitality like that to half-a-dozen rogues from
      Arroquhar, who had already made a warm night for ye, was surely stretched
      a little too far. What did ye open for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo seemed to range his mind for a reply. He looked to Montaiglon, but
      got no answer in the Frenchman's face; he looked over Montaiglon's
      shoulder at Olivia, standing yet in the tremour of her fears, and his eye
      lingered. It was no wonder, thought Count Victor, that it lingered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, I'm waiting my answer!&rdquo; cried Doom, in a voice that might
      have stirred a corps in the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought there wasna mair than ane,&rdquo; said Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even one! At this time of morning! And is it your custom to open to a
      summons of that kind without finding out who calls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I kent the voice,&rdquo; said Mungo, furtively looking again at
      Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whose was it, this voice that could command so ready and foolish an
      acquiescence on the part of my honest sentinel Mungo Boyd?&rdquo; asked Doom
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye can ask that!&rdquo; replied the servant desperately; &ldquo;it's mair than I can
      tell. All I ken is that I thought the voice fair-spoken, and I alloo it
      was a daft-like thing to do, but I pu'ed the bar, I had nae sooner dune't
      nor I was gripped by the thrapple and kep' doon by a couple o' the
      blackguards that held me a' the time the ither three or four were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom caught him by the collar and shook him angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye lie, ye Fife cat; I see't in your face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can speak as to the single voice and its humility, and to the sudden
      plucking forth of this gentleman,&rdquo; said Count Victor quietly, at sea over
      this examination. But for the presence of the woman he would have cried
      out at the mockery of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must hear my explanation, Montaiglon,&rdquo; said Doom. &ldquo;If you will come
      to the hall, I will give it. Olivia, you will come too. I should have
      taken your hints of yesterday morning, and the explanation of this might
      have been unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom and his guest went to the <i>salle</i>; Olivia lingered a moment
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it, Mungo?&rdquo; said she, whisperingly to the servant. &ldquo;I know by the
      face of you that you are keeping something from my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Humph! It's Fife very soon for Mungo Boyd, I'm tellin'
      ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who was it?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arroquhar men,&rdquo; said he curtly; &ldquo;and that's all I ken aboot it,&rdquo; and
      he turned to leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not the truth, Mungo,&rdquo; said Olivia, with great dignity. &ldquo;I
      think with my father that you are telling what is not the true word,&rdquo; and
      she said no more, but followed to the <i>salle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the stairway Count Victor had trod upon the button he had drawn from
      the skirts of his assailant; he picked it up without a word, to keep it as
      a souvenir. Doom preceded him into the room, lit some candles hurriedly at
      the smouldering fire, and turned to offer him a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our&mdash;our friends are gone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You seem to have badly wounded
      one of them, for the others carried him bleeding to the water-side, as we
      have seen from his blood-marks on the rock: they have gone, as they
      apparently must have come, by boat. Sit down, Olivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His daughter had entered. She had hurriedly coiled her hair up, and the
      happy carelessness of it pleased Montaiglon's eye like a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he said nothing; he could not trust himself to speak, facing, as he
      fancied yet he did, a traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see from your face you must still be dubious of me,&rdquo; said Doom. He
      waited for no reply, but paced up and down the room excitedly, the pleats
      of his kilt and the thongs of his purse swinging to his movements: a
      handsome figure, as Mont-aiglon could not but confess. &ldquo;I am still
      shattered at the nerve to think that I had almost taken your life there in
      a fool's blunder. You must wonder to see me in this&mdash;in this
      costume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not even yet come to his explanation, and Olivia must help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What my father would tell you, if he was not in such a trouble, Count
      Victor, is what I did my best to let you know last night. It is just that
      he breaks the laws of George the king in this small affair of our Highland
      tartan. It is a fancy of his to be wearing it in an evening, and the bats
      in the chapel upstairs are too blind to know what a rebel it is that must
      be play-acting old days and old styles among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint light came suddenly to Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is not, mademoiselle, that the bats alone are blind;
      here is a very blind Montaiglon. I implore your pardon, M. le Baron. It is
      good to be frank, though it is sometimes unpleasant, and I must plead
      guilty to an imbecile misapprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom flushed, and took the proffered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Montaiglon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm the most shamefaced man this day in
      the shire of Argyll. Need I be telling you that I have all Olivia's
      sentiment and none of her honest courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear father!&rdquo; cried Olivia fondly, looking with melting eyes at her
      parent; and Count Victor, too, thought this mummer no inadmirable figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing more than my indulgence in the tartan that makes your host
      look sometimes scarcely trustworthy; and my secret got its right
      punishment this night. I will not be able to wear a kilt with an easy
      conscience for some time to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith! Baron, that were a penance out of all proportion!&rdquo; said Count
      Victor, laughing. &ldquo;If you nearly gave me the key of the Olympian meadows
      there, 'tis I that have brought these outlaws about your ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What beats me is that they should make so much ado about a trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trifle!&rdquo; said Count Victor. &ldquo;True, in a sense. The wretch but died. We
      must all die; we all know it, though none of us believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to say that after all you only wounded yon Macfarlane; so
      Petullo learned but yesterday, and I clean forgot to tell you sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Montaiglon looked mightily relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I shall give a score of the best candles to St. Denys&mdash;if
      I remember when I get home again. You could not have told me such good
      tidings a moment too soon, dear M. le Baron, though of course a small
      affair like that would naturally escape one's memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was as good as dead, by all rumour; but being a thief and an Arroquhar
      man, he naturally recovered: and now it's the oddest thing in the world
      that an accident of the nature, that is all, as Black Andy well must know,
      in the ordinary way of business, should bring about so much <i>fracas</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was part of my delusion,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;to fancy Mungo not
      entirely innocent. As you observed, he opened the door with an excess of
      hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was droll,&rdquo; confessed Doom, reflectively. &ldquo;That was droll,
      indeed; but Mungo hates the very name of Arroquhar, and all that comes
      from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except our Annapla,&rdquo; suggested Olivia, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, except Annapla, of course!&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;He's to marry her to
      avert her Evil Eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is she a Macfarlane?&rdquo; asked Montaiglon, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No less,&rdquo; replied Doom. &ldquo;She's a cousin of Andy's; but there's little
      love lost between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of bats!&rdquo; thought Count Victor, but he did not hint at his new
      conclusions. &ldquo;Well, I am glad,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;they left me but remorse last
      time; this time here's a souvenir,&rdquo; and he showed the button.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a silver chamfered lozenge, conspicuous and unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen gear, doubtless,&rdquo; guessed the Baron, looking at it with
      indifference. &ldquo;Silver buttons are not rife between here and the pass of
      Balmaha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it, please?&rdquo; said Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it in her hand but for a moment, turned slightly aside to look
      more closely at it in the sconce-light, paled with some emotion, and gave
      it back with slightly trembling fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a headache,&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;I am not so brave as I thought I
      was; you will let me say good night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled to Count Victor with a face most wan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are like a ghost,&rdquo; said her father, and as she left the room
      he looked after her affectionately.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX &mdash; AN EVENING'S MELODY IN THE BOAR'S HEAD INN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Boar's Head Inn, for all its fine cognomen, was little better than any
      of the numerous taverns that kept discreet half-open doors to the wynds
      and closes of the Duke's burgh town, but custom made it a preserve of the
      upper class in the community. There it was the writers met their clients
      and cozened them into costly law pleas over the genial jug or chopine; the
      through-going stranger took his pack there and dwelt cheaply in the attics
      that looked upon the bay and upon the little harbour where traffic dozed
      upon the swinging tide, waiting the goodwill of mariners in no hurry to
      leave a port so alluring; in its smoke-grimed public-room skippers
      frequented, full of loud tales of roving, and even the retinue of
      MacCailen was not averse from an evening's merriment in a company where no
      restraint of the castle was expected, and his Grace was mentioned but
      vaguely as a personal pronoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in the inn a <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> where only were allowed
      the bailies of the burgh, a tacksman of position, perhaps, from the
      landward part, or the like of the Duke's Chamberlain, who was no
      bacchanal, but loved the company of honest men in their hours of
      manumission. Here the bottle was of the best, and the conversation most
      genteel&mdash;otherwise there had been no Sim MacTaggart in the company
      where he reigned the king. It was a state that called for shrewd
      deportment. One must not be too free, for an excess of freedom cheapened
      the affability, and yet one must be hail fellow with magistrate&mdash;and
      even an odd master mariner&mdash;with no touch of condescension for the
      Highland among them who could scent the same like <i>aqua vito</i> and
      resent it like a push of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came not often, but ever was he welcome, those nights the more glorious
      for his qualities of humour and generosity, his tales that stirred like
      the brassy cry of trumpets, his tolerance of the fool and his folly, his
      fatalist excuse for any sin except the scurviest. And there was the
      flageolet! You will hear the echo of it yet in that burgh town where he
      performed; its charm lingers in melodies hummed or piped by old folks of
      winter nights, its magic has been made the stuff of myth, so that as
      children we have heard the sound of Simon's instrument in the spring woods
      when we went there white-hay-gathering, or for fagots for the schoolhouse
      fire.

    <p>
      A few nights after that thundering canter from the spider's den where Kate
      Petullo sat amid her coils, the Chamberlain went to wander care among easy
      hearts. It was a season of mild weather though on the eve of winter; even
      yet the perfume of the stubble-field and of fruitage in forest and
      plantation breathed all about the country of Mac-Cailen Mor. Before the
      windows of the inn the bay lay warm and placid, and Dunchuach,
      wood-mantled, and the hills beyond it vague, remote, and haunted all by
      story, seemed to swim in a benign air, and the outer world drew the souls
      of these men in a tavern into a brief acquaintanceship. The window of the
      large room they sat in looked out upon this world new lit by the tender
      moon that hung on Strome. A magistrate made to shutter it and bring the
      hour of Bacchus all the faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold there, Bailie!&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain. &ldquo;Good God! let us have so
      long as we can of a night so clean and wholesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It needed but a hint of that nature from this creature of romance and
      curious destiny to silence their unprofitable discourse over herds and
      session discipline, and for a space they sat about the window, surrendered
      to the beauty of the night. So still that outer world, so vacant of living
      creature, that it might have been a picture! In the midst of their half
      circle the Chamberlain lay back in his chair and drank the vision in by
      gloating eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said he at last in a voice that had the rich profound of
      passion&mdash;&ldquo;upon my word, we are the undeserving dogs!&rdquo; and at an
      impulse he took his flageolet and played a Highland air. It had the proper
      spirit of the hour&mdash;the rapturous evening pipe of birds in dewy
      thickets, serene yet someway touched by melancholy; there was no man there
      among them who did not in his breast repeat its words that have been heard
      for generations in hillside milking-folds where women put their ruddy
      cheeks against the kine and look along the valleys, singing softly to the
      accompaniment of the gushing pail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held his audience by a chain of gold: perhaps he knew it, perhaps he
      joyed in it, but his half-shut eyes revealed no more than that he still
      saw the beauty and peace of the night and thus rendered an oblation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His melody ceased as abruptly as it began. Up he got hastily and stamped
      his foot and turned to the table where the bottle lay and cried loud out
      for lights, as one might do ashamed of a womanly weakness, and it is the
      Highland heart that his friends should like him all the more for that
      display of sentiment and shyness to confess it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord, Factor, and it's you have the skill of it!&rdquo; said the
      Provost, in tones of lofty admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is't the bit reed?&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, indifferently. &ldquo;Your boy Davie
      could learn to play better than I in a month's lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no' altogether the playing though,&rdquo; said the Provost slowly,
      ruminating as on a problem; &ldquo;it's that too, but it's more than that; it's
      the seizing of the time and tune to play. I'm no great musicianer myself,
      though I have tried the trump; but there the now&mdash;with the night like
      that, and us like this, and all the rest of it&mdash;that lilt of yours&mdash;oh,
      damn! pass the bottle; what for should a man be melancholy?&rdquo; He poured
      some wine and gulped it hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard the beat of it!&rdquo; said the others. &ldquo;Give us a rant, Factor,&rdquo;
       and round the table they gathered: the candles were being lit, the
      ambrosial night was to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon MacTaggart looked round his company&mdash;at some with the maudlin
      tear of sentiment still on their cheeks, at others eager to escape this
      soft moment and make the beaker clink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sorrow!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;what a corps to entertain! Is it the same stuff
      as myself? Is this the best that Sim MacTaggart that knows and feels
      things can be doing? And still they're worthy fellows, still I must be
      liking them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rants!&rdquo; he cried, and stood among them tall and straight and handsome,
      with lowering dark brows, and his face more pale than they had known it
      customarily,&mdash;&ldquo;a little less rant would be the better for us. Take my
      word for it, the canty quiet lilt in the evening, and the lights low, and
      calm and honest thoughts with us, is better than all the rant and chorus,
      and I've tried them both. But heaven forbid that Sim MacTaggart should
      turn to preaching in his middle age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! and it's very true what you say, Factor,&rdquo; acquiesced some
      sycophant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain looked at him half in pity, half in amusement. &ldquo;How do <i>you</i>
      ken, Bailie?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what are yearlings at Fa'kirk Tryst?&rdquo; And then,
      waiting no answer to what demanded none, he put the flageolet to his lips
      again and began to play a strathspey to which the company in the true
      bucolic style beat time with feet below the table. He changed to the tune
      of a minuet, then essayed at a melody more sweet and haunting than them
      all, but broken ere its finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hole in the ballant,&rdquo; commented the Provost. &ldquo;Have another skelp at it,
      Factor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later on perhaps,&rdquo; said Sim MacTaggart. &ldquo;The end of it aye escapes my
      memory. Rather a taking tune, I think&mdash;don't you? Just a little&mdash;just
      a little too much of the psalm in it for common everyday use, but man! it
      grips me curiously;&rdquo; and then on a hint from one at his shoulder he played
      &ldquo;The Devil in the Kitchen,&rdquo; a dance that might have charmed the imps of
      Hallowe'en.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the midst of it when the door of the room opened and a beggar
      looked in&mdash;a starven character of the neighbourhood parish, all
      bedecked with cheap brooches and babs of ribbon, leading by the hand the
      little child of his daughter wronged and dead. He said never a word but
      stood just within the door expectant&mdash;a reproach to cleanliness,
      content, good clothes, the well fed, and all who make believe to love
      their fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, Baldy!&rdquo; cried the Bailies sharply, vexed by this intrusion on
      their moments of carouse; no one of them had a friendly eye for the old
      wanderer, in his blue coat, and dumb but for his beggar's badge and the
      child that clung to his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the child that Sim MacTaggart saw. He thought of many things as he
      looked at the little one, white-haired, bare-footed, and large-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, my dear!&rdquo; said he, quite tenderly, smiling upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have been afraid but for the manifest kindness of that dark
      commanding stranger; it was only shyness that kept her from obeying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain rose and went over to the door and cried upon the
      landlord. &ldquo;You will have a chopine of ale, Baldy,&rdquo; said he to the old
      wreck; &ldquo;sometimes it's all the difference between hell-fire and content,
      and&mdash;for God's sake buy the bairn a pair of boots!&rdquo; As he spoke he
      slipped, by a motion studiously concealed from the company, some silver
      into the beggar's poke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ale came in, the beggar drank for a moment, the Chamberlain took the
      child upon his knee, his face made fine and noble by some sweet human
      sentiment, and he kissed her, ere she went, upon the brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of the Boar's Head Inn was ill at
      ease. This sort of thing&mdash;so common in Sim MacTaggart,who made
      friends with every gangrel he met&mdash;was like a week-day sermon, and
      they considered the Sunday homilies of Dr. Macivor quite enough. They much
      preferred their Simon in his more common mood of wild devilry, and nobody
      knew it better than the gentleman himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn the lousy tribe of them!&rdquo; cried he, beating his palm upon the
      table; &ldquo;what's Long Davie the dempster thinking of to be letting such folk
      come scorning here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant they get more encouragement here than they do in Lorn,&rdquo; said
      the Provost, shrewdly, for he had seen the glint of coin and knew his man.
      &ldquo;You beat all, Factor! If I lived a hundred years, you would be more than
      I could fathom. Well, well, pass the bottle, and ye might have another
      skelp at yon tune if it's your pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain most willingly complied: it was the easiest retort to the
      Provost's vague allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played the tune again; once more its conclusion baffled him, and as he
      tried a futile repetition Count Victor stood listening in the lobby of the
      Boar's Head Inn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI &mdash; COUNT VICTOR CHANGES HIS QUARTERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Count Victor said <i>Au revoir</i> to Doom Castle that afternoon. Mungo
      had rowed him down by boat to the harbour and left him with his valise at
      the inn, pleased mightily that his cares as garrison were to be relieved
      by the departure of one who so much attracted the unpleasant attention of
      nocturnal foes, and returned home with the easiest mind he had enjoyed
      since the fateful day the Frenchman waded to the rock. As for Count
      Victor, his feelings were mingled. He had left Doom from a double sense of
      duty, and yet had he been another man he would have bided for love. After
      last evening's uproar, plain decency demanded that Jonah should obviate a
      repetition by removing himself elsewhere. There was also another
      consideration as pregnant, yet more delicate: the traditions of his class
      and family as well as his natural sense of honour compelled his separation
      from the fascinating influence of the ingenuous woman whose affections
      were pledged in another quarter. In a couple of days he had fallen
      desperately in love with Olivia&mdash;a precipitation that might seem
      ridiculous in any man of the world who was not a Montaiglon satiated by
      acquaintance with scores of Dame Stratagems, fair <i>intrigueuses</i> and
      puppets without hearts below their modish bodices. Olivia charmed by her
      freshness, and the simple frankness of her nature, with its deep emotions,
      gave him infinitely more surprise and thrill than any woman he had met
      before. &ldquo;Wisdom wanting absolute honesty,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is only
      craft: I discover that a monstrous deal of cleverness I have seen in her
      sex is only another kind of cosmetic daubed on with a sponge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, too, Olivia that morning seemed to have become all of a sudden
      very cold to him. He was piqued at her silence, he was more than piqued to
      discover that she too, like Mungo, obviously considered his removal a
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold him, then, with his quarters taken in the Boar's Head Inn, whence
      by good luck the legal gang of Edinburgh had some hours before departed,
      standing in the entrance feeling himself more the foreigner than ever,
      with the vexing reflection that he had not made any progress in the object
      of his embassy, but, on the contrary, had lost no little degree of his
      zest therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the flageolet was at once a blow and a salute. That
      unaccomplished air had helped to woo Olivia in her bower, but yet it gave
      a link with her, the solace of the thought that here was one she knew. Was
      it not something of good fortune that it should lead him to identify and
      meet one whose very name was still unknown to him, but with whom he was,
      in a faint measure, on slight terms of confederacy through the confession
      of Olivia and the confidence of Mungo Boyd?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Toujours l'audace!</i>&rdquo; thought he, and he asked for the innkeeper's
      introduction to the performer. &ldquo;If it may be permitted, and the gentleman
      is not too pressingly engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the innkeeper&mdash;a jovial rosy gentleman, typical of his
      kind&mdash;&ldquo;indeed, and it may very well be permitted, and it would not be
      altogether to my disadvantage that his lordship should be out of there,
      for the Bailies cannot very well be drinking deep and listening to Mr.
      Simon MacTag-gart's songs, as I have experienced afore. The name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never heard it,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;but it happens to be Montaiglon,
      and I was till this moment in the odd position of not knowing his, though
      we have a common friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later the Chamberlain stood before him with the end of the
      flageolet protruding from the breast of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they met in the narrow confine of the lobby&mdash;on either hand of
      them closed rooms noisy with clink of drinking-ware, with laugh and jest
      and all that rumour of carouse&mdash;Montaiglon's first impression was
      exceeding favourable. This Chamberlain pleased his eye to start with; his
      manner was fine-bred in spite of a second's confusion; his accent was
      cordial, and the flageolet displayed with no attempt at concealment,
      captured the heart of the Frenchman, who had been long enough in these
      isles to weary of a national character that dare not surrender itself to
      any unbusiness-like frisking in the meadows. And one thing more there was
      revealed&mdash;here was the kilted gallant of the miniature in Olivia's
      chamber, and here was the unfriendly horseman of the wood, here in fine
      was the lover of the story, and the jealousy (if it was a jealousy) he had
      felt in the wood, forgotten, for he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he was face to face with Olivia's lover, Count Victor discovered
      that he had not the slightest excuse for referring to her who was the only
      association between them! The lady herself and Mungo Boyd had conveyed a
      sense of very close conspiracy between all four, but from neither the lady
      nor any one else in Doom had he any passport to the friendship of this
      gentleman. It was only for a moment the difficulties of the situation
      mastered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have permitted myself, monsieur, to intrude upon you upon an excuse
      that must seem scandalously inadequate,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My name is Montaiglon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the particle, I think?&rdquo; said Sim MacTaggart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor started slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is so, though I never march with much baggage, and
      a De to a traveller is like a second hat. It is, then, that it is perhaps
      unnecessary to say more of myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain with much <i>bonhomie</i> grasped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Montaiglon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am very proud to meet you. I fancy a certain
      lady and I owe something to your consideration, and Simon MacTaggart
      stands upon no ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor winced slightly at the conjunction, but otherwise he was
      delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ravished, monsieur!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ceremony is like some people's
      assumption of dignity&mdash;the false bottoms they put in their boots to
      conceal the fact that they are under the average height, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arm in arm they went out in front of the inn and walked along the bay, and
      the Provost and the Bailies were left mourning for their king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not fancy the name and the reputation of the gentlemen of
      Cammercy unknown in these parts,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain. &ldquo;When the lady&mdash;who
      need not be more specifically mentioned&mdash;told me you had come to
      Doom, it was like the over-come of a song at first that I had heard of you
      before. And now that I see you, I mind the story went, when I was at
      Dunkerque some years ago, that Count Victor Jean, if all his other natural
      gifts had failed him, might have made a noble fortune as a <i>maître
      d'escrime</i>. Sir, I am an indifferent hand with the rapier myself, but I
      aye liked to see a man that was its master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said Montaiglon, &ldquo;and yet such a reputation,
      exaggerated as I fear it may be, is not, by my faith! the one I should
      desire under the circumstances that, as you have doubtless further heard,
      bring me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that, M. Montaiglon, it is perhaps as well that the Duke of
      Argyll's Chamberlain should know nothing at all. You are a wild lot, my
      gallant Jacobites&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed softly as he spoke. &ldquo;Between ourselves
      I have been more than bottle friends with some lovable persons on your
      side of the house, and you will be good enough to consider Simon
      MacTaggart no politician, though the Duke's Chamberlain <i>ex officio</i>
      is bound to be enemy to every man who will not swear King George the best
      of monarchs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I know of affairs in Europe now, and for all our heroics of
      invasion,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;his Majesty is like to remain in undisputed
      possession, and you may take my word for it, no affair of high politics is
      responsible for my being here. Monsieur himself has doubtless had affairs.
      I am seeking but for one man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drimdarroch,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain. &ldquo;So the lady told me. Our Drimdarroch
      will not provide very much interest for a <i>maître d'escrime</i>,&rdquo; and he
      laughed as he pictured Petullo the writer shivering before a flash of
      steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you speak of the lawyer: Doom told me of him, and as he was good
      enough to interest himself in my lodging in this place, I must make him my
      compliments at the earliest and tell him I have settled down for myself in
      the <i>auberge</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that much at least I can help you, though in the other affair I'm
      neutral in spite of my interest in any ploy of the kind. There's Petullo's
      house across the way; I'm on certain terms with him; if you care, we could
      see him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Le plus tôt sera le mieux!</i>&rdquo; said Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain led the way.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII &mdash; THE LONELY LADY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Petullo's work was done of an evening it was his practice to sit with
      his wife in their huge and draughty parlour, practising the good husband
      and the domestic virtues in an upright zealous manner, such as one may
      read of in the books. A noble thing to do, but what's the good of it when
      hearts are miles apart and the practitioner is a man of rags? Yet there he
      sat, strewing himself with snuff to keep himself awake, blinking with dim
      eyes at her, wondering for ever at her inscrutable nature, conversing
      improvingly upon his cases in the courts, or upon his growing fortune that
      he computed nightly like a miser. Sometimes, in spite of his drenchings of
      macabaw, sleep compelled him, and, humped in his lug-chair, he would
      forget his duty, yet waken at her every yawn. And she&mdash;she just
      looked at him as he slept! She looked&mdash;and loathed herself, that she&mdash;so
      clean, so graceful, so sweet in spite of all her sin&mdash;should be
      allied with a dead man. The evenings passed for her on fettered hours; but
      for the window she had died from her incubus, or at least stood up and
      shrieked and ran into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the window! From there she saw the hill Dunchuach, so tranquil,
      and the bosky deeps of Shira Glen that she knew so well in dusky evenings
      and in moonlight, and must ever tenant, in her fancy, with the man she
      used to meet there. Often she would turn her back upon that wizened atomy
      of quirks and false ideals, and let her bosom pant to think to-night!&mdash;to-night!&mdash;to-night!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Chamberlain and Montaiglon were announced she could have cried
      aloud with joy. It was not hard in that moment of her elation to
      understand why once the Chamberlain had loved her; beside the man to whom
      her own mad young ambition manacled her she seemed a vision of beauty none
      the worse for being just a little ripened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come awa' in!&rdquo; cried the lawyer with effusion. &ldquo;You'll find the mistress
      and me our lones, and nearly tiring o' each other's company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain was disappointed. It was one of those evenings when Mrs.
      Petullo was used to seek him in the woods, and he had thought to find her
      husband by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perfect picture of a happy hearth, eh?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm sweared to spoil
      it, but I'm bound to lose no time in bringing to you my good friend M.
      Montaiglon, who has taken up his quarters at the Boar's Head. Madam, may I
      have the pleasure of introducing to you M. Montaiglon?&rdquo; and Sim
      Mac-Taggart looked in her eyes with some impatience, for she hung just a
      second too long upon his fingers, and pinched ere she released them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was delighted to make monsieur's acquaintance. Her husband had told
      her that monsieur was staying farther up the coast and intended to come to
      town.. Monsieur was in business; she feared times were not what they were
      for business in Argyll, but the air was bracing&mdash;and much to the same
      effect, which sent the pseudo wine merchant gladly into the hands of her
      less ceremonious husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Petullo, he was lukewarm. He saw no prospects of profit from this
      dubious foreigner thrust upon his attention by his well-squeezed client
      the Baron of Doom. Yet something of style, some sign of race in the
      stranger, thawed him out of his suspicious reserve, and he was kind enough
      to be condescending to his visitor while cursing the man who sent him
      there and the man who guided him. They sat together at the window, and
      meanwhile in the inner end of the room a lonely lady made shameful love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sim!&rdquo; she whispered, sitting beside him on the couch and placing the
      candlestick on a table behind them; &ldquo;this is just like old times&mdash;the
      dear darling old times, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She referred to the first of their <i>liaison</i>, when they made their
      love in that same room under the very nose of a purblind husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain toyed with his silver box and found it easiest to get out
      of a response by a sigh that might mean anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the loveliest hand,&rdquo; she went on, looking at his fingers, that
      certainly were shapely enough, as no one knew better than Simon
      Mac-Taggart. &ldquo;I don't say you are in any way handsome,&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes
      betrayed her real thought,&mdash;&ldquo;but I'll admit to the hands,&mdash;they're
      dear pets, Sim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thrust them in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! Kate!&rdquo; he protested in a low tone, and assuming a quite
      unnecessary look of vacuity for the benefit of the husband, who gazed
      across the dim-lit room at them, &ldquo;don't behave like an idiot; faithful
      wives never let their husbands see them looking like that at another man's
      fingers. What do you think of our monsher? He's a pretty enough fellow, if
      you'll not give me the credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's good enough, I daresay,&rdquo; she answered without looking aside a
      moment. &ldquo;I would think him much better if he was an inch or two taller, a
      shade blacker, and Hielan' to boot. But tell me this, and tell me no more,
      Sim; where has your lordship been for three whole days? Three whole days,
      Simon MacTaggart, and not a word of explanation. Are you not ashamed of
      yourself, sir? Do you know that I was along the riverside every night this
      week? Can you fancy what I felt to hear your flageolet playing for tipsy
      fools in Ludovic's room? Very well, I said: let him! I have pride of my
      own, and I was so angry to-night that I said I would never go again to
      meet you. You cannot blame me if I was not there to-night, Sim. But there!&mdash;seeing
      you have rued your cruelty to me and made an excuse to see me even before
      him, there, I'll forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well!&rdquo; drawled the Chamberlain, ambiguously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't make another excuse this week. He sits in here every night,
      and has a new daft notion for late suppers. Blame yourself for it, Sim,
      but there can be no trysts this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a most singularly unlucky person,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, in a tone
      that deaf love alone could fail to take alarm at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a story to-day that frightened me, Sim,&rdquo; she went on, taking up
      some fine knitting and bending over it while she spoke rapidly, always in
      tones too low to carry across the room. &ldquo;It was that you have been hanging
      about that girl of Doom's you met here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain damned internally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't believe all you hear, Kate,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And even if it was the
      case,&rdquo;&mdash;he broke off in a faint laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if what?&rdquo; she repeated, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if&mdash;even if there was anything in the story, who's to blame?
      Your goodman's not the ass he sometimes looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he was the first to put her in your way, and that he had
      his own reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo's fingers rushed the life out of her knitting. &ldquo;If I thought&mdash;if
      I thought!&rdquo; she said, leaving the sentence unfinished. No more was
      necessary; Sim MacTaggart thanked heaven he was not mated irrevocably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is it true of you, Sim, who did your best to
      make me push Petullo to Doom's ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear, you talk the damnedest nonsense!&rdquo; said Simon MacTaggart
      firmly. &ldquo;I pushed in no way; the fool dropped into your husband's hands
      like a ripe plum. I have plenty of shortcomings of my own to answer for
      without getting the blame of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't lie like that, Sim, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petullo, decidedly. &ldquo;My memory
      is not gone yet, though you seem to think me getting old. Oh yes! I have
      all my faculties about me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to the Lord you had prudence; old Vellum's cocking his lugs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't care if he is; you make me desperate, Sim.&rdquo; Her needles
      thrust like poignards, her bosom heaved. &ldquo;You may deny it if you like, but
      who pressed me to urge him on to take Drim-darroch? Who said it might be
      so happy a home for us when&mdash;when&mdash;my goodman there&mdash;when I
      was free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! what a hangman's notion!&rdquo; thought the Chamberlain to himself,
      with a swift side glance at this termagant, and a single thought of calm
      Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing to say to that, Sim, I see. It's just too late in the
      day for you to be virtuous, laddie; your Kate knows you and she likes you
      better as you are than as you think you would like to be. We were so
      happy, Sim, we were so happy!&rdquo; A tear dropped on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now heaven forgive me for my infernal folly!&rdquo; cried out the soul of Sim
      MacTaggart; but never a word did he say aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor, at the other end of the room, listening to Petullo upon
      wines he was supposed to sell and whereof Petullo was supposed to be a
      connoisseur, though as a fact his honest taste was buttermilk&mdash;Count
      Victor became interested in the other pair. He saw what it took younger
      eyes, and a different experience from those of the husband, to observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cognac,&rdquo;&mdash;this to M. le Connoisseur with the rheumy eye&mdash;&ldquo;but
      yes, it is good; your taste in that must be a national affair, is it not?
      Our best, the La Rochelle, has the name of a Scot&mdash;I think of Fife&mdash;upon
      the cask;&rdquo; but to himself, with a glance again at the tragic comedy in the
      corner of the couch, &ldquo;<i>Fi donc!</i> Mungo had reason; my gentleman of
      the dark eye is suspiciously like <i>cavalière servante</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain began to speak fast upon topics of no moment, dreading the
      consequence of this surrender on the woman's part: she heard nothing as
      she thrust furiously and blindly with her needles, her eyes suffused with
      tears courageously restrained. At last she checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that means, Sim, that it's true about the girl,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I tried
      to think it was a lie when I heard it, but now you compel me to believe
      you are a brute. You are a brute, Sim, do you hear that? Oh God! oh God!
      that ever I saw you! That ever I believed you! What is wrong with me, Sim?
      tell me, Sim! What is wrong with me? Am I different in any way from what I
      was last spring? Surely I'm not so old as all that; not a grey hair in my
      head, not a wrinkle on my face. I could keep like that for twenty years
      yet, just for love of Sim MacTaggart. Sim, say something, for the love of
      Heaven! Say it's a lie. Laugh at the story, Sim! Oh, Sim! Sim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knitting needles clicked upon each other in her trembling hands, like
      fairy castanets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will say that man's fate is in his own fingers?&rdquo; the Chamberlain
      asked himself, at the very end of patience. &ldquo;From the day I breathed I got
      no chance. A clean and decent road's before me and a comrade for it, and
      I'm in the mood to take it, and here's the glaur about my feet! I wonder
      what monsieur there would do in a plight like mine. Lord! I envy him to be
      sitting there, and never a skeleton tugging at his sleeve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo gulped a sob, and gave a single glance into his face as he
      stared across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you hate that man?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said he smiling, and glad that the wild rush of reproach was
      checked. &ldquo;Is it monsher? I hate nobody, my dear Kate, except sometimes
      myself for sin and folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still and on you hate that man,&rdquo; said she convinced. &ldquo;Oh no! not with
      that face, with the face you had a second ago. I think&mdash;oh! I can
      guess the reason; he has been up in Doom Castle; has he been getting round
      Miss Milk-and-Water? If he has, he's far more like her than you are. You
      made me pauperise her father, Sim; I'm sorry it was not worse. I'll see
      that Petullo has them rouped from the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adorable Kate!&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face flamed, she pressed her hand on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not forget that, Sim,&rdquo; said she with a voice of marvellous calm,
      bracing herself to look indifferently across the room at her husband.
      &ldquo;I'll not forget many things, Sim. I thought the man I was to raise from
      the lackey that you were ten years ago would have some gratitude. No, no,
      no, Sim; I do not mean that, forgive me. Don't look at me like that! Where
      are you to be to-morrow night, Sim? I could meet you at the bridge; I'll
      make some excuse, and I want you to see my new gown&mdash;such a gown,
      Sim! I know what you're thinking, it would be too dark to see it; but you
      could strike a light, sweetheart, and look. Do you mind when you did that
      over and over again the first time, to see my eyes? I'm not going to say
      another word about&mdash;about Miss Milk-and-Water, if that's what angers
      you. She could never understand my Sim, or love the very worm he tramps on
      as I do. Now look at me smiling; ain't I brave? Would any one know to see
      me that my heart was sore? Be kind to me, Sim, oh! be kind to me; you
      should be kind to me, with all you promised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is smiling into a mist; alas! poor M. Petullo!&rdquo; thought Count
      Victor, seeing the lady standing up and looking across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain in a whisper, pulling unobserved at her gown,
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down again in a transport, her cheeks reddening, her eyes dancing;
      poor soul! she was glad nowadays of the very crumbs of affection from Sim
      MacTaggart's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are going to say 'Yes' for to-morrow night, Sim,&rdquo; said she
      triumphant. &ldquo;Oh, you are my own darling! For that I'll forgive you
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's to be no more nonsense of this kind, Kate,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain.
      &ldquo;We have been fools&mdash;I see that quite plainly&mdash;and I'm not going
      to carry it on any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very kind of you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petullo, with the ring of metal in
      her accent and her eyes on fire. &ldquo;Do you feel a great deal of remorse
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said he, wondering what she was to be at next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! I was aye sure your conscience would be the death of you some
      day. And it's to be the pretext for throwing over unhappy Kate Cameron, is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Kate Cameron&mdash;her I loved&mdash;but Mrs. Petullo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom you only made-believe to? That is spoken like a true Highland
      gentleman, Sim. I'm to be dismissed with just that amount of politeness
      that will save my feelings. I thought you knew me better, Sim. I thought
      you could make a more plausible excuse than that for the dirty transaction
      when it had to be done, as they say it must be done some time with all who
      are in our position. As sure as death I prefer the old country style
      that's in the songs, where he laughs and rides away. But I'm no fool, Sim;
      what about Miss Milk-and-Water? Has she been hearing about me, I wonder,
      and finding fault with her new jo? The Lord help her if she trusts him as
      I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to give me a chance, Kate,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain desperately.
      Petullo and the Count were still intently talking; the tragedy was in the
      poor light of a guttering candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chance?&rdquo; she repeated vaguely, her eyes in vacancy, a broken heart
      shown in the corners of her mouth, the sudden aging of her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it, Kate; you understand, don't you? A chance. I'm a boy no
      longer. I want to be a better man&mdash;&rdquo; The sentence trailed off, for
      the Chamberlain could not but see himself in the most contemptible of
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better man!&rdquo; said she, her knitting and her hands drowned in her lap,
      her countenance hollow and wan. &ldquo;Lord keep me, a better man! And am I to
      be any the better woman when my old lover is turned righteous? Have you
      no' a thought at all for me when I'm to be left with him that's not my
      actual husband, left without love, hope, or self-respect? God help poor
      women! It's Milk-and-Water then; that's settled, and I'm to see you at the
      kirk with her for a lifetime of Sundays after this, an honest woman, and
      me what I am for you that have forgotten me&mdash;forgotten me! I was as
      good as she when you knew me first, Sim; I was not bad, and oh, my God!
      but I loved you, Sim Mac-Taggart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all that's damnable,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain to himself, &ldquo;there's
      nothing beats a whining woman!&rdquo; He was in a mortal terror that her
      transports could be heard across the room, and that would be to spoil all
      with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God pity women!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It's a lesson. I was so happy sometimes
      that it frightened me, and now I know I was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, my dear?&rdquo; cried out Petullo across the room,
      suspiciously. He fancied he had heard an over-eager accent in her last
      words, that were louder spoken than all that had gone before. Fortunately
      he could not make out her face as he looked, otherwise he would have seen,
      as Montaiglon did with some surprise, a mask of Tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm giving Mr. MacTaggart my congratulations on his coming marriage,&rdquo;
       said she quickly, with a miraculous effort at a little laugh, and the
      Chamberlain cursed internally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it's that length, is it?&rdquo; said Petullo with a tone of gratification.
      &ldquo;Did I no' tell you, Kate? You would deny't, and now you have the best
      authority. Well, well, it's the way we a' maun gang, as the auld blin'
      woman said, and here's wishing you the best o' luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came across to shake hands, but the Chamberlain checked him hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Madame's just a little premature, Mr. Petullo; there
      must be no word o' this just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that way?&rdquo; said Petullo. &ldquo;Likely the Baron's thrawn. Man, he hasna
      a roost, and he should be glad&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped on reflection that the
      Frenchman was an intimate of the family he spoke of, and hastily returned
      to his side without seeing the pallor of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it was old Vellum who clyped to you,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain to the
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it all plainly now,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He brought her here just to put her
      in your way and punish me. Oh, heavens, I'll make him rue for that! And do
      you fancy I'm going to let you go so easily as all that, Sim? Will Miss
      Mim-mou' not be shocked if I tell her the truth about her sweetheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not dare!&rdquo; said the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! would I not?&rdquo; Mrs. Petullo smiled in a fashion that showed she
      appreciated the triumph of her argument. &ldquo;What would I not do for my Sim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's all by, anyway,&rdquo; said he shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, with her?&rdquo; said Mrs. Petullo, but with no note of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, with you,&rdquo; said he brutally. &ldquo;Let us be friends, good friends, Kate,&rdquo;
       he went on, fearing this should too seriously arouse her. &ldquo;I'll be the
      best friend you have in the world, my dear, if you'll let me, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only you will never kiss me again,&rdquo; said she with a sob. &ldquo;There can be no
      friendship after you, Sim, and you know it. You are but lying again. Oh,
      God! oh, God! I wish I were dead! You have done your worst, Simon
      MacTaggart; and if all tales be true&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not saying a word of what I might say in my own defence,&rdquo; he
      protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>could</i> you say in your own defence? There is not the ghost of
      an excuse for you. What <i>could</i> you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could be pushed to an obvious enough retort,&rdquo; he said, losing
      patience, for now it was plain that they were outraging every etiquette by
      so long talking together while others were in the room. &ldquo;I was to blame,
      Heaven knows! I'm not denying that, but you&mdash;but you&mdash;&rdquo; And his
      fingers nervously sought in his coat for the flageolet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo's face flamed. &ldquo;Oh, you hound!&rdquo; she hissed, &ldquo;you hound!&rdquo; and
      then she laughed softly, hysterically. &ldquo;That is the gentleman for you! The
      seed of kings, no less! What a brag it was! That is the gentleman for you!&mdash;to
      put the blame on me. No, Sim; no, Sim; I will not betray you to Miss
      Mim-mou', you need not be feared of that; I'll let her find you out for
      herself and then it will be too late. And, oh! I hate her! hate her! hate
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; said the Chamberlain with a sudden memory of the
      purity she envied, and at these words Mrs. Petullo fell in a swoon upon
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, what's the matter?&rdquo; cried her husband, running to her side, then
      crying for the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the slightest idea,&rdquo; said Sim MacTag-gart. &ldquo;But she looked ill
      from the first,&rdquo; and once more he inwardly cursed his fate that constantly
      embroiled him in such affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later he and the Count were told the lady had come round, and
      with expressions of deep sympathy they left Petullo's dwelling.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII &mdash; A MAN OF NOBLE SENTIMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a silence between the two for a little after they came out from
      Petullo's distracted household. With a chilling sentiment towards his new
      acquaintance, whom he judged the cause of the unhappy woman's state, Count
      Victor waited for the excuse he knew inevitable. He could not see the
      Chamberlain's face, for the night was dark now; the tide, unseen, was
      running up on the beach of the bay, lights were burning in the dwellings
      of the little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Montaiglon,&rdquo; at last said the Chamberlain in a curious voice where
      feelings the most deep appeared to strive together, &ldquo;yon's a tragedy, if
      you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Comment?</i>&rdquo; said the Count. He was not prepared for an opening quite
      like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, &ldquo;you saw it for yourself; you are not a mole
      like Petullo the husband. By God! I would be that brute's death if he were
      thirty years younger, and made of anything else than sawdust. It's a
      tragedy in there, and look at this burgh!&mdash;like the grave but for the
      lights of it; rural, plodding, unambitious, ignorant&mdash;and the last
      place on earth you might seek in for a story so peetiful as that in there.
      My heart's wae, wae for that woman; I saw her face was like a corp when we
      went in first, though she put a fair front on to us. A woman in a hundred;
      a brave woman, few like her, let me tell you, M. Montaiglon, and
      heartbroken by that rat she's married on. I could greet to think on all
      her trials. You saw she was raised somewhat; you saw I have some influence
      in that quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For his life Count Victor could make no reply, so troubled was his mind
      with warring thoughts of Olivia betrayed, perhaps, to a debauchee <i>sans</i>
      heart and common pot-house decency; of whether in truth this was the
      debauchee to such depths as he suggested, or a man in a false position
      through the stress of things around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain went on as in a meditation. &ldquo;Poor Kate! poor Kate! We were
      bairns together, M. Montaiglon, innocent bairns, and happy, twenty years
      syne, and I will not say but what in her maidenhood there was some warmth
      between us, so that I know her well. She was compelled by her relatives to
      marriage with our parchment friend yonder, and there you have the start of
      what has been hell on earth for her. The man has not the soul of a louse,
      and as for her, she's the finest gold! You would see that I was the cause
      of her swoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy creature!&rdquo; said Montaiglon, beginning to fear he had wronged this
      good gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well say it, M. Montaiglon. It is improper, perhaps, that I
      should expose to a stranger the skeleton of that house, but I'm feeling
      what happened just now too much to heed a convention.&rdquo; He sighed
      profoundly. &ldquo;I have had influence with the good woman, as you would see;
      for years I've had it, because I was her only link with the gay world she
      was born to be an ornament in, and the only one free to be trusted with
      the tale of her misery. Well, you know&mdash;you are a man of the world,
      M. Montaiglon&mdash;you know the dangers of such a correspondence between
      a person of my reputation, that is none of the best, because I have been
      less a hypocrite than most, and a lady in her position. It's a gossiping
      community this, long-lugged and scandal-loving like all communities of its
      size; it is not the Faubourg St. Honoré, where intrigues go on behind fans
      and never an eye cocked or a word said about it; and I'll not deny but
      there have been scandalous and cruel things said about the lady and
      myself. Now, as God's my judge&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, monsieur,&rdquo; said the Count, eager to save this protesting
      gentleman another <i>bêtise</i>; &ldquo;I quite understand, I think,&mdash;the
      lady finds you a discreet friend. Naturally her illness has unmanned you.
      The scandal of the world need never trouble a good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a merely middling-good man, M. Montaiglon,&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain;
      &ldquo;you'll allow that's a difference. Lord knows I lay no claim to a crystal
      virtue! In this matter I have no regard for my own reputation, but just
      for that very reason I'm anxious about the lady's. What happened in that
      room there was that I've had to do an ill thing and make an end of an auld
      sang. I'm rarely discreet in my own interest, M. Montaiglon, but it had to
      be shown this time, and as sure as death I feel like a murderer at the
      havoc I have wrought with that good woman's mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly; a lump was in his throat. In the beam of light that
      came through the hole in a shutter of a house they passed, Montaiglon saw
      that his companion's face was all wrought with wretchedness, and a tear
      was on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery took him aback. He had ungenerously deemed the strained
      voice in the darkness beside him a mere piece of play-acting, but here was
      proof of genuine feeling, all the more convincing because the Chamberlain
      suddenly brisked up and coughed and assumed a new tone, as if ashamed of
      his surrender to a sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been compelled to be cruel to-night to a woman, M. Montaiglon,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;and that is not my nature. And&mdash;to come to another
      consideration that weighed as much with me as any&mdash;this unpleasant
      duty of mine that still sticks in my throat like funeral-cake was partly
      forced by consideration for another lady&mdash;the sweetest and the best&mdash;who
      would be the last I should care to have hear any ill of me, even in a
      libel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A protest rose to Montaiglon's throat; a fury stirred him at the gaucherie
      that should bring Olivia's name upon the top of such a subject. He could
      not trust himself to speak with calmness, and it was to his great relief
      the Chamberlain changed the topic&mdash;broadened it, at least, and spoke
      of women in the general, almost cheerfully, as if he delighted to put an
      unpleasant topic behind him. It was done so adroitly, too, that Count
      Victor was compelled to believe it prompted by a courteous desire on the
      part of the Chamberlain not too vividly to illuminate his happiness in the
      affection of Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an older man than you, M. Montaiglon,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, &ldquo;and I
      may be allowed to give some of my own conclusions upon the fair. I have
      known good, ill, and merely middling among them, the cunning and the
      simple, the learned and the utterly ignorant, and by the Holy Iron!
      honesty and faith are the best virtues in the lot of them. They all like
      flattery, I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dead man and a stupid woman are the only ones who do not. <i>Jamais
      beau parler riecorcha le langue!</i>&rdquo; said Montaiglon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, and that's very true,&rdquo; consented the Chamberlain, laughing softly.
      &ldquo;I take it not amiss myself if it's proffered in the right way&mdash;which
      is to say, for the qualities I know I have, and not for the imaginary
      ones. As I was saying, give me the simple heart and honesty; they're not
      very rife in our own sex, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even there, monsieur, I can be generous enough,&rdquo; said Montaiglon. &ldquo;I can
      always retain my regard for human nature, because I have learned never to
      expect too much from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said!&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain. &ldquo;Do you know that in your manner of
      rejoinder you recall one Dumont I met once at the Jesuits' College when I
      was in France years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have passed some time in my country, then?&rdquo; said the Count with
      awakened interest, a little glad of a topic scarce so abstruse as sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been in every part of Europe,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain; &ldquo;and it must
      have been by the oddest of mischances I have not been at Cammercy itself,
      for well I knew your uncle's friends, though, as it happened, we were of a
      different complexion of politics. I lived for months one time in the Hôtel
      de Transylvania, Rue Condé, and kept my <i>carosse de remise</i>, and
      gambled like every other ass of my kind in Paris till I had not a louis to
      my credit. Lord! the old days, the old days! I should be penitent, I
      daresay, M. Montaiglon, but I'm putting that off till I find that a sober
      life has compensations for the entertainment of a life of liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know Balhaldie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know the inside of my own pocket! I've played piquet wi' the old
      rogue a score of times in the Sun tavern of Rotterdam. Pardon me speaking
      that way of one that may be an intimate of your own, but to be quite
      honest, the Scots gentlemen living on the Scots Fund in France in these
      days were what I call the scourings of the Hielan's. There were good and
      bad among them, of course, but I was there in the <i>entourage</i> of one
      who was no politician, which was just my own case, and I saw but the
      convivial of my exiled countrymen in their convivial hours. Politics! In
      these days I would scunner at the very word, if you know what that means,
      M. Montaiglon. I was too throng with gaiety to trouble my head about such
      trifles; my time was too much taken up with buckling my hair, in admiring
      the cut of my laced <i>jabot</i>, and the Mechlin of my wrist-bands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking close upon the sea-wall with leisurely steps,
      preoccupied, the head of the little town, it seemed, wholly surrendered to
      themselves alone. Into the Chamberlain's voice had come an accent of the
      utmost friendliness and flattering ir-restraint; he seemed to be leaving
      his heart bare to the Frenchman. Count Victor was by these last words
      transported to his native city, and his own far-off days of galliard. Why,
      in the name of Heaven! was he here listening to hackneyed tales of
      domestic tragedy and a stranger's reminiscences? Why did his mind
      continually linger round the rock of Doom, so noisy on its promontory, so
      sad, so stern, so like an ancient saga in its spirit? Cecile&mdash;he was
      amazed at it, but Cecile, and the Jacobite cause he had come here to
      avenge with a youth's ardour, had both fallen, as it were, into a dusk of
      memory!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, monsieur, you did not happen to have come upon any one
      remotely suggesting my Drimdarroch in the course of your travels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; cried Sim MacTaggart; &ldquo;if I did, was I like to mention it here
      and now?&rdquo; He laughed at the idea. &ldquo;You have not grasped the clannishness
      of us yet if you fancy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in an affair of strict honour, monsieur,&rdquo; broke in Count Victor
      eagerly. &ldquo;Figure you a woman basely betrayed; your admirable sentiments
      regarding the sex must compel you to admit there is here something more
      than clannishness can condone. It is true there is the political element&mdash;but
      not much of it&mdash;in my quest, still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word of that, M. Montaiglon!&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain: &ldquo;there you
      address yourself to his Grace's faithful servant; but I cannot be denying
      some sympathy with the other half of your object. If I had known this
      by-named Drimdarroch you look for, I might have swithered to confess it,
      but as it is, I have never had the honour. I've seen scores of dubious
      cattle round the walls of Ludo-vico Rex, but which might be Drimdarroch
      and which might be decent honest men, I could not at this time guess. We
      have here among us others who had a closer touch with affairs in France
      than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Count Victor. &ldquo;Our friend the Baron of Doom suggested that for
      that very reason my search was for the proverbial needle in the haystack.
      I find myself in pressing need of a judicious friend at court, I see. Have
      you ever found your resolution quit you&mdash;not an oozing courage, I
      mean, but an indifference that comes purely by the lapse of time and the
      distractions on the way to its execution? It is my case at the moment. My
      thirst for the blood of this <i>inconnu</i> has modified considerably in
      the past few days. I begin to wish myself home again, and might set out
      incontinent if the object of my coming here at all had not been so well
      known to those I left behind. You would be doing a brilliant service&mdash;and
      perhaps but little harm to Drimdarroch after all&mdash;if you could
      arrange a meeting at the earliest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! I'm touched by the issue,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain; &ldquo;I must cast an eye
      about. Drimdarroch, of course, is Doom, or was, if a lawyer's sheep-skins
      had not been more powerful nowadays than the sword; but&rdquo;&mdash;he paused a
      moment as if reluctant to give words to the innuendo&mdash;&ldquo;though Doom
      himself has been in France to some good purpose in nis time, and though,
      for God knows what, he is no friend of mine, I would be the first to
      proclaim him free of any suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, monsieur, goes without saying! I was stupid enough to misunderstand
      some of his eccentricities myself, but have learned in our brief
      acquaintanceship to respect in him the man of genuine heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, just so!&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain, and cleared his throat. &ldquo;I but
      mentioned his name to make it plain that his claim to the old title in no
      way implicated him. A man of great heart, as you say, though with a
      reputation for oddity. If I were not the well-wisher of his house, I could
      make some trouble about his devotion to the dress and arms forbidden here
      to all but those in the king's service, as I am myself, being major of the
      local Fencibles. And&mdash;by the Lord! here's MacCailen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had by this time entered the policies of the Duke. A figure walked
      alone in the obscurity, with arms in a characteristic fashion behind its
      back, going in the direction they themselves were taking. For a second or
      two the Chamberlain hesitated, then formed his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall introduce you,&rdquo; he said to Count Victor. &ldquo;It may be of some
      service afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke turned his face in the darkness, and, as they came alongside,
      recognised his Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, good evening!&rdquo; he cried cheerfully. &ldquo;'Art a late bird, as
      usual, and I am at that pestilent task the rehearsal of a speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace's industry is a reproach to your Grace's Chamberlain,&rdquo; said
      the latter. &ldquo;I have been at the speech-making myself, partly to a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. MacTaggart!&rdquo; cried the Duke in a comical expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And partly to this unfortunate friend of mine, who must fancy us a
      singularly garrulous race this side of the German Ocean. May I introduce
      M. Montaiglon, who is at the inn below, and whom it has been my good
      fortune to meet for the first time to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll was most cordial to the stranger, who, however, took the earliest
      opportunity to plead fatigue and return to his inn. He had no sooner
      retired than the Duke expressed some natural curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be the person you desired for the furnishing of our tolbooth
      the other day, Sim?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No less,&rdquo; frankly responded the Chamberlain. &ldquo;Your Grace saved me a <i>faux
      pas</i> there, for Montaiglon is not what I fancied at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were ever the dubious gentleman, Sim,&rdquo; laughed his Grace. &ldquo;And what&mdash;if
      I may take the liberty&mdash;seeks our excellent and impeccable Gaul so
      far west?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a wine merchant,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, and at that the Duke
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, man!&rdquo; he cried at last, shaking with his merriment, &ldquo;is our ancient
      Jules from Oporto to be ousted with the aid of Sim MacTaggart from the
      ducal cellars in favour of one Montaiglon?&rdquo; He stopped, caught his
      Chamberlain by the arm, and stood close in an endeavour to perceive his
      countenance. &ldquo;Sim,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wonder what Modene would say to find his
      cousin hawking vile claret round Argyll. Your friend's incognito is
      scarcely complete enough even in the dark. Why, the man's Born! I could
      tell it in his first sentence, and it's a swordsman's hand, not a
      cellarer's fingers, he gave me a moment ago. That itself would betray him
      even if I did not happen to know that the Montaiglons have the <i>particule</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite as you say,&rdquo; confessed the Chamberlain with some chagrin at
      his position, &ldquo;but I'm giving the man's tale as he desires to have it
      known here. He's no less than the Count de Montaiglon, and a rather decent
      specimen of the kind, so far as I can judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why the <i>alias</i>, good Sim?&rdquo; asked the Duke. &ldquo;I like not your <i>aliases</i>,
      though they have been, now and then&mdash;ahem!&mdash;useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace has travelled before now as Baron Hay,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! true! and saved very little either in inn charges or in the pother
      of State by the device. And if I remember correctly, I made no pretence at
      wine-selling on these occasions. Honestly now, what the devil does the
      Comte de Montaiglon do here&mdash;and with Sim MacTaggart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is capable of the easiest explanation. He's here on what he is
      pleased to call an affair of honour, in which there is implicated the
      usual girl and another gentleman, who, it appears, is some ope, still
      unknown, about your Grace's castle.&rdquo; And the story in its entirety was
      speedily his Grace's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; ejaculated Argyll at last when he had heard all. &ldquo;And you fancy the
      quest as hopeless as it is quixotic? Now mark me! Simon; I read our French
      friend, even in the dark, quite differently. He had little to say there,
      but little as it was 'twas enough to show by its manner that he's just the
      one who will find his man even in my crowded corridors.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIV &mdash; A BROKEN TRYST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain's quarters were in the eastern turret, and there he went
      so soon as he could leave his Grace, who quickly forgot the Frenchman and
      his story, practising upon Simon the speech he had prepared in his evening
      walk, alternated with praise extravagant&mdash;youthfully rapturous almost&mdash;of
      his duchess, who might, from all his chafing at her absence, have been
      that night at the other end of the world, instead of merely in the next
      county on a few days' visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are smiling, Sim!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Old whinstone! You fancy Argyll an
      imbecile of uxoriousness. Well, well, my friend, you are at liberty; Lord
      knows, it's not a common disease among dukes! Eh, Sim? But then women like
      my Jean are not common either or marriages were less fashions. Upon my
      word, I could saddle Jock and ride this very night to Luss, just to have
      the fun of throwing pebbles at her window in the morning, and see her
      wonder and pleasure at finding me there. Do you know what, cousin? I am
      going to give a ball when she comes home. We'll have just the neighbours,
      and I'll ask M. Soi-disant, who'll give us the very latest step. I like
      the fellow's voice, it rings the sterling metal.... And now, my lords,
      this action on the part of the Government.... Oh, the devil fly away with
      politics! I must go to a lonely bed!&rdquo; And off set Mac-Cailen Mor, the
      noble, the august, the man of silk and steel, whom 'twas Simon
      MacTaggart's one steadfast ambition in life to resemble even in a remote
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we have the Chamberlain in his turret room, envious of that
      blissful married man, and warmed to a sympathetic glow with Olivia
      floating through the images that rose before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the curtains of his window and looked in that direction where
      Doom, of course, was not for material eyes, finding a vague pleasure in
      building up the picture of the recluse tower, dark upon its promontory. It
      was ten o'clock. It had been arranged at their last meeting that without
      the usual signal he should go to her to-night before twelve. Already his
      heart beat quickly; his face was warm and tingling with pleasant
      excitation, he felt a good man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If it was not for the old glaur! What for does heaven&mdash;or
      hell&mdash;send the worst of its temptations to the young and ignorant? If
      I had met her twenty years ago! Twenty years ago! H'm! 'Clack!' goes the
      weaver's shuttle! Twenty years ago it was her mother, and Sim MacTaggart
      without a hair on his face trying to kiss the good lady of Doom, and her,
      perhaps na' half unwilling. I'm glad&mdash;I'm glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put on a pair of spurs, his fingers trembling as those of a lad
      dressing for his first ball, and the girl a fairy in white, with her neck
      pink and soft and her eyes shy like little fawns in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how near I was to missing it!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;But for the scheming of a
      fool I would never have seen her. It's not too late, thank the Lord for
      that! No more of yon for Sim MacTaggart. I've cut with the last of it, and
      now my face is to the stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hands were spotless white, but he poured some water in a basin and
      washed them carefully, shrugging his shoulders with a momentary
      comprehension of how laughable must that sacrament be in the eyes of the
      worldly Sim MacTaggart. He splashed the water on his lips, drew on a
      cloak, blew out the light, and went softly downstairs and out at a side
      door for which he had a pass-key. The night was still, except for the
      melancholy sound of the river running over its cascades and echoing under
      the two bridges; odours of decaying leaves surrounded him, and the air of
      the night touched him on his hot face like a benediction. A heavy dew
      clogged the grass of Cairnbaan as he made for the stables, where a man
      stood out in the yard waiting with a black horse saddled. Without a word
      he mounted and rode, the hoofs thudding dull on the grass. He left behind
      him the castle, quite dark and looming in its nest below the sentinel
      hill; he turned the bay; the town revealed a light or two; a bird screamed
      on the ebb shore. Something of all he saw and heard touched a fine man in
      his cloak, touched a decent love in him; his heart was full with wholesome
      joyous ichor; and he sang softly to the creaking saddle, sang an air of
      good and clean old Gaelic sentiment that haunted his lips until he came
      opposite the very walls of Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fastened his horse to a young hazel and crossed the sandy interval
      between the mainland and the rock, sea-wrack bladders bursting under his
      feet, and the smells of seaweed dominant over the odours of the winter
      wood. The tower was pitch dark. He went into the bower, sat on the rotten
      seat among the damp bedraggled strands of climbing flowers, and took his
      flageolet from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played softly, breathing in the instrument the very pang of love. It
      might have been a psalm and this forsaken dew-drenched bower a great
      cathedral, so rapt, so devoted, his spirit as he sought to utter the very
      deepest ecstasy. Into the reed he poured remembrance and regret; the
      gathered nights of riot and folly lived and sorrowed for; the ideals
      cherished and surrendered; the remorseful sinner, the awakened soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one paid any heed in Castle Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      That struck him suddenly with wonder, as he ceased his playing for a
      moment and looked through the broken trellis to see the building black
      below the starry sky. There ought, at least, to be a light in the window
      of Olivia's room. She had made the tryst herself, and never before had she
      failed to keep it. Perhaps she had not heard him. And so to his flageolet
      again, finding a consolation in the sweetness of his own performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he to himself, pausing to admire&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! there's no doubt I
      finger it decently well&mdash;better than most&mdash;better than any I've
      heard, and what's the wonder at that? for it's all in what you feel, and
      the most of people are made of green wood. There's no green timber here;
      I'm cursed if I'm not the very ancient stuff of fiddles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never felt happier in all his life. The past?&mdash;he wiped that
      off his recollection as with a sponge; now he was a new man with his feet
      out of the mire and a clean road all the rest of the way, with a clean
      sweet soul for his companion. He loved her to his very heart of hearts; he
      had, honestly, for her but the rendered passion of passion&mdash;why! what
      kept her?
    </p>
    <p>
      He rammed the flageolet impatiently into his waistcoat, threw back his
      cloak, and stepped out into the garden. Doom Castle rose over him black,
      high and low, without a glimmer. A terrific apprehension took possession
      of him. He raised his head and gave the signal call, so natural that it
      drew an answer almost like an echo from an actual bird far off in some
      thicket at Achnatra. And oh! felicity; here she was at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bolts of the door slid back softly; the door opened; a little figure
      came out. Forward swept the lover, all impatient fires&mdash;to find
      himself before Mungo Boyd!
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught him by the collar of his coat as if he would shake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What game is this? what game is this?&rdquo; he furiously demanded. &ldquo;Where is
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canny, man, canny!&rdquo; said the little servitor, releasing himself with
      difficulty from the grasp of this impetuous lover. &ldquo;Faith! it's anither
      warnin' this no' to parley at nicht wi' onything less than twa or three
      inch o' oak dale atween ye and herm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut clavers and tell me what ails your mistress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, weel; she hisna come oot the nicht,&rdquo; said Mungo, waving his arms to
      bring the whole neighbourhood as witness of the obvious fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain thrust at his chest and nearly threw him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye dull-witted Lowland brock!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;have I no' the use of my own
      eyes? Give me another word but what I want and I'll slash ye smaller than
      ye are already with my Ferrara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm no' that wee!&rdquo; said Mungo. &ldquo;If ye wad jist bide cool&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cool' quo' he! Man! I'm up to the neck in fire. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whaur ony decent lass should be at this 'oor o' the nicht&mdash;in her
      naked bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that again, you foul-mouthed dog o' Fife, and I'll gralloch you like
      a deer!&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain, his face tingling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losh! the body's cracked,&rdquo; said Mungo Boyd, astounded at this nicety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was to meet her to-night; does she know I'm here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rapped at her door mysel' to mak' sure she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what said she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She tauld me to gae awa'. I said it was you, and she said it didna
      maitter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didna maitter!&rdquo; repeated the Chamberlain, viciously, mimicking the
      eastland accent. &ldquo;What ails her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ought to ken that best yoursel'. It was the last thing I daur ask
      her,&rdquo; said Mungo Boyd, preparing to retreat, but his precaution was not
      called for, he had stunned his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain drew his cloak about him, cold with a contemptuous rebuff.
      His mouth parched; violent emotions wrought in him, but he recovered in a
      moment, and did his best to hide his sense of ignominy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it's a woman's way, Mungo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll likely ken,&rdquo; said Mungo; &ldquo;I've had sma' troke wi' them mysel'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky man! And now that I mind right, I think it was not to-night I was
      to come, after all; I must have made a mistake. If you have a chance in
      the morn's morning you can tell her I wasted a tune or two o' the
      flageolet on a wheen stars. It is a pleasant thing in stars, Mungo, that
      ye aye ken where to find them when ye want them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the rock, and took to horse again, and home. All through the dark
      ride he fervently cursed Count Victor, a prey of an idiotic jealousy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV &mdash; RECONCILIATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mungo stood in the dark till the last beat of the horse-hoofs could be
      heard, and then went in disconsolate and perplexed. He drew the bars as it
      were upon a dear friend out in the night, and felt as there had gone the
      final hope for Doom and its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An auld done rickle o' a place!&rdquo; he soliloquised, lifting a candle high
      that it might show the shame of the denuded and crumbling walls. &ldquo;An auld
      done rickle: I've seen a better barn i' the Lothians, and fancy me tryin'
      to let on that it's a kind o' Edinbro'! Sirs! sirs! 'If ye canna hae the
      puddin' be contented wi' the bree,' Annapla's aye sayin', but here there's
      neither bree nor puddin'. To think that a' my traison against the master
      i' the interest o' his dochter and himsel' should come to naethin', and
      that Sim MacTaggart should be sent awa' wi' a flea in his lug, a' for the
      tirravee o' a lassie that canna' value a guid chance when it offers! I
      wonder what ails her, if it's no' that mon-sher's ta'en her fancy! Women
      are a' like weans; they never see the crack in an auld toy till some ane
      shows them a new ane. Weel! as sure as death I wash my haun's o' the hale
      affair. She's daft; clean daft, puir dear! If she kent whit I ken, she
      micht hae some excuse, but I took guid care o' that. I doot yon's the end
      o' a very promisin' match, and the man, though he mayna' think it, has his
      merchin' orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brief bow-legged figure rolled along the lobby, pshawing with
      vexation, and in a little, Doom, to all appearance, was a castle dark and
      desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet not wholly asleep, however dark and silent; for Olivia, too, had heard
      the last of the thundering hoofs, had suffered the agony that comes from
      the wrench of a false ideal from the place of its long cherishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down in the morning a mere wraith of beauty, as it seemed to the
      little servitor, shutting her lips hard, but ready to burst into a shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guid Lord!&rdquo; thought Mungo, setting the scanty table. &ldquo;It's clear she
      hasna steeked an e'e a' nicht, and me sleepin' like a peerie. That's ane
      o' the advantages o' being ower the uneasy age o' love&mdash;and still I'm
      no' that auld. I wonder if she's rued it the day already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled upon him bravely, but woe-begone, and could not check a
      quivering lip, and then she essayed at a song hummed with no bad pretence
      as she cast from the window a glance along the wintry coast, that never
      changed its aspect though hearts broke. But, as ill-luck had it, the air
      was the unfinished melody of Sim's bewitching flageolet. She stopped it
      ere she had gone farther than a bar or two, and turned to find Mungo
      irresolute and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ga'ed awa'&mdash;&rdquo; began the little man, with the whisper of the
      conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mungo!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you will not say a word of it. It is all bye with me,
      and what for not with you? I command you to say no more about it, do you
      hear?&rdquo; And her foot beat with an imperiousness almost comical from one
      with such a broken countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a gey droll thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a gey hard thing, that is what it is,&rdquo; she interrupted him, &ldquo;that
      you will not do what I tell you, and say nothing of what I have no relish
      to hear, and must have black shame to think of. Must I go over all that I
      have said to you already? It is finished, Mungo; are you listening? Did he&mdash;did
      he&mdash;looked vexed? But it does not matter, it is finished, and I have
      been a very foolish girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that needna' prevent me tellin' ye that the puir man's awa' clean
      gyte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled just the ghost of a smile at that, then put her hands upon her
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried despairingly, &ldquo;have I not a friend left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo sighed and said no more then, but went to Annapla and sought relief
      for his feelings in bilingual wrangling with that dark abigail. At low
      tide beggars from Glen Croe came to his door with yawning pokes and all
      their old effrontery: he astounded them by the fiercest of receptions,
      condemned them all eternally for limmers and sorners, lusty rogues and
      vagabonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awa'! awa'!&rdquo; he cried, an implacable face against their whining
      protestations&mdash;&ldquo;Awa', or I'll gie ye the gairde! If I was my uncle
      Erchie, I wad pit an end to your argy-bargying wi' hail frae a gun!&rdquo; But
      to Annapla it was, &ldquo;Puir deevils, it's gey hard to gie them the back o'
      the haun' and them sae used to rougher times in Doom. What'll they think
      o' us? It's sic a doon-come, but we maun be hainin' seein' Leevie's lost
      her jo, and no ither way clear oot o' the bit. I'm seein' a toom girnel
      and done beef here lang afore next Martinmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These plaints were to a woman blissfully beyond comprehending the full
      import of them, for so much was Annapla taken up with her Gift, so misty
      and remote the realms of Gaelic dream wherein she moved, that the little
      Lowland oddity's perturbation was beneath her serious attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olivia had that day perhaps the bitterest of her life. With love outside&mdash;calling
      in the evening and fluting in the bower, and ever (as she thought)
      occupied with her image even when farther apart&mdash;she had little fault
      to find with the shabby interior of her home. Now that love was lost, she
      sat with her father, oppressed and cold as it had been a vault. Even in
      his preoccupation he could not fail to see how ill she seemed that
      morning: it appeared to him that she had the look of a mountain birch
      stricken by the first of wintry weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, with a tenderness that had been some time absent from
      their relations, &ldquo;you must be taking a change of air. I'm a poor parent
      not to have seen before how much you need it.&rdquo; He hastened to correct what
      he fancied from her face was a misapprehension. &ldquo;I am speaking for your
      red cheeks, my dear, believe me; I'm wae to see you like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do whatever you wish, father,&rdquo; said Olivia in much agitation.
      Coerced she was iron, coaxed she was clay. &ldquo;I have not been a very good
      daughter to you, father; after this I will be trying to be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face reddened; his heart beat at this capitulation of his rebel: he
      rose from his chair and took her into his arms&mdash;an odd display for a
      man so long stone-cold but to his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, my dear!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but in one detail that need never again be
      named between us two, you have been the best of girls, and, God knows, I
      am not the pattern parent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her arm went round his neck, and she wept on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sour and dour&mdash;&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And poor to penury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more need for a loving child. There are only the two of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her at arm's-length and looked at her wistfully in the wet wan
      face and saw his wife Christina there. &ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it is no
      wonder that this man should hunt her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made me happy this day, Olivia,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;at least half happy.
      I dare not mention what more was needed to make me quite content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I know, and that&mdash;and that&mdash;is over
      too. I am just your own Olivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried elate; &ldquo;no more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now praise God!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have been robbed of Credit and estate, and
      even of my name; I have seen king and country foully done by, and black
      affront brought on our people, and still there's something left to live
      for.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI &mdash; THE DUKE'S BALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      For some days Count Victor chafed at the dull and somewhat squalid life of
      the inn. He found himself regarded coldly among strangers; the flageolet
      sounded no longer in the private parlour; the Chamberlain stayed away. And
      if Drimdarroch had seemed ill to find from Doom, he was absolutely
      indiscoverable here. Perhaps there was less eagerness in the search
      because other affairs would for ever intrude&mdash;not the Cause (that
      now, to tell the truth, he somehow regarded moribund; little wonder after
      eight years' inaction!) nor the poignant home-thoughts that made his ride
      through Scotland melancholy, but affairs more recent, and Olivia's eyes
      possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A morning had come of terrific snow, and made all the colder, too, his
      sojourn in the country of MacCailen Mor. Now he looked upon mountains
      white and far, phantom valleys gulping chilly winds, the sea alone with
      some of its familiar aspect, yet it, too, leaden to eye and heart as it
      lay in a perpetual haze between the headlands and lazily rose and fell in
      the bays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of the ball was to him like a reprieve. From the darkness of
      those woody deeps below Dunchuach the castle gleamed with fires, and a
      Highland welcome illumined the greater part of the avenue from the town
      with flambeaux, in whose radiance the black pines, the huge beeches, the
      waxen shrubbery round the lawns all shrouded, seemed to creep closer round
      the edifice to hear the sounds of revelry and learn what charms the human
      world when the melodious winds are still and the weather is cold, and out
      of doors poor thickets must shiver in appalling darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gush of music met Count Victor at the threshold; dresses were rustling,
      a caressing warmth sighed round him, and his host was very genial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Montaiglon,&rdquo; said his Grace in French, &ldquo;you will pardon our short
      notice; my good friend, M. Montaiglon, my dear; my wife, M. Montaiglon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But M. Montaiglon merely in the inns, my lord,&rdquo; corrected the Frenchman,
      smiling. &ldquo;I should be the last to accept the honour of your hospitality
      under a <i>nom de guerre</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke bowed. &ldquo;M. le Comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be quite as candid as
      yourself, I pierced your incognito even in the dark. My dear sir, a Scots
      traveller named for the time being the Baron Hay once had the privilege of
      sharing a glass coach with your uncle between Paris and Dunkerque; 'tis a
      story that will keep. Meanwhile, as I say, M. Montaiglon will pardon the
      shortness of our notice; in these wilds one's dancing shoes are presumed
      to be ever airing at the fire. You must consider these doors as open as
      the woods so long as your are in this neighbourhood. I have some things I
      should like to show you that you might not find wholly uninteresting&mdash;a
      Raphael, a Rembrandt (so reputed), and several Venetians&mdash;not much,
      in faith, but regarding which I should value your criticism&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some other guests arrived, his Grace's speech was broken, and Count Victor
      passed on, skirting the dancers, who to his unaccustomed eyes presented
      features strange yet picturesque as they moved in the puzzling involutions
      of a country dance. It was a noble hall hung round with tapestry and
      bossed with Highland targets, trophies of arms and the mountain chase;
      from the gallery round it drooped little banners with the devices of all
      those generations of great families that mingled in the blood of MacCailen
      Mor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman looked round him for a familiar face, and saw the
      Chamberlain in Highland dress in the midst of a little group of dames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo was not one of them. She was dancing with her husband&mdash;a
      pitiful spectacle, for the lawyer must be pushed through the dance as he
      were a doll, with monstrous ungracefulness, and no sense of the time of
      the music, his thin legs quarrelling with each other, his neighbours all
      confused by his inexpert gyrations, and yet himself with a smirk of
      satisfaction on his sweating countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is not happy,&rdquo; thought Count Victor, watching the lady who was
      compelled to be a partner in these ungainly gambols.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed Mrs. Petullo was far from happy, if her face betrayed her real
      feelings, as she shared the ignominy of the false position into which
      Petullo had compelled her. When the dance was ended she did not take her
      husband's proffered arm, but walked before him to her seat, utterly
      ignoring his pathetic courtesies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little domestic comedy only engaged Count Victor for a moment; he
      felt vexed for a woman in a position for which there seemed no remedy, and
      he sought distraction from his uneasy feeling by passing every man in the
      room under review, and guessing which of them, if any, could be the
      Drim-darroch who had brought him there from France. It was a baffling
      task. For many were there with faces wholly inscrutable who might very
      well have among them the secret he cherished, and yet nothing about them
      to advertise the scamp who had figured so effectively in other scenes than
      these. The Duke, their chief, moved now among them&mdash;suave, graceful,
      affectionate, his lady on his arm, sometimes squeezing her hand, a very
      boy in love!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a grand picture of matrimonial felicity, Count,&rdquo; said a voice at
      Count Victor's ear, and he turned to find the Chamberlain beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively it makes me half envious, monsieur,&rdquo; said Count Victor. &ldquo;A
      following influenced by the old feudal affections and wellnigh
      worshipping; health and wealth, ambitions gratified, a name that has
      sounded in camp and Court, yet a heart that has stayed at home; the fever
      of youth abated, and wedded to a beautiful woman who does not weary one,
      <i>pardieu!</i> his Grace has nothing more in this world to wish for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! he has most that's needed to make it a very comfortable world.
      Providence is good&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sometimes grudging&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sometimes grudging, as you say; yet MacCailen has got everything.
      When I see him and her there so content I'm wondering at my own wasted
      years of bachelordom. As sure as you're there, I think the sooner I draw
      in at a fire and play my flageolet to the guidwife the better for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a gift, this domesticity,&rdquo; said Count Victor, not without an inward
      twinge at the picture. &ldquo;Some of us have it, some of us have not, and no
      trying hard for content with one's own wife and early suppers will avail
      unless one is born to it like the trick of the Sonnet. I have been
      watching our good friend, your lawyer's wife, distracted over the&mdash;over
      the&mdash;<i>balourdise</i> of her husband as a dancer: he dances like a
      bootmaker's sign, if you can imagine that, and I dare not approach them
      till her very natural indignation has simmered down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain looked across, the hall distastefully and found Mrs.
      Petullo's eyes on him. She shrugged, for his perception alone, a white
      shoulder in a manner that was eloquent of many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil!&rdquo; he muttered, yet essayed at the smile of good friendship
      which was now to be their currency, and a poor exchange for the old gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely Monsieur MacTaggart dances?&rdquo; said the Count; &ldquo;I see a score of
      ladies here who would give their garters for the privilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dancing days are over,&rdquo; said Sim MacTaggart, but merely as one who
      repeats a formula; his eyes were roving among the women. The dark
      green-and-blue tartan of the house well became him: he wore diced hose of
      silk and a knife on the calf of his leg; his plaid swung from a stud at
      the shoulder, and fell in voluminous and graceful folds behind him. His
      eyes roved among the women, and now and then he lifted the whitest of
      hands and rubbed his shaven chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor was a little amused at the vanity of this village hero. And
      then there happened what more deeply impressed him with wonder at the
      contrarieties of character here represented, for the hero brimmed with
      sentimental tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were caused by so simple a thing as a savage strain of music from the
      Duke's piper, who strutted in the gallery fingering a melody in an
      interval of the dance&mdash;a melody full of wearisome iterations in the
      ears of the foreigner, who could gain nothing of fancy from the same save
      that the low notes sobbed. When the piece was calling in the hall, ringing
      stormily to the roof, shaking the banners, silencing the guests, the
      Duke's Chamberlain laughed with some confusion in a pretence that he was
      undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An air with a story, perhaps?&rdquo; asked Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all stories,&rdquo; answered this odd person, so responsive to the
      yell of guttural reeds. &ldquo;In that they are like our old friend Balhaldie,
      whose tales, as you may remember&mdash;the old rogue!&mdash;would fill
      many pages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many leaves, indeed,&rdquo; said Count Victor&mdash;&ldquo;preferably fig-leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bagpipe moves me like a weeping woman, and here, for all that, is the
      most indifferent of musicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tenez!</i> monsieur; I present my homages to the best of
      flageolet-players,&rdquo; said Count Victor, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flageolet! a poor instrument, and still&mdash;and still not without
      its qualities. Here's one at least who finds it the very salve for
      weariness. Playing it, I often feel in the trance of rapture. I wish to
      God I could live my life upon the flute, for there I'm on the best and
      cleanest terms with myself, and no backwash of penitence. Eh! listen to me
      preaching!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one air I have heard of yours&mdash;so!&mdash;that somehow
      haunts me,&rdquo; said Count Victor; &ldquo;its conclusion seemed to baffle you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it does, man, so it does! If I found the end of that, I fancy I would
      find a new MacTaggart. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's not a run of notes I
      want&mdash;indeed the air's my own, and I might make it what I chose&mdash;but
      an experience or something of that sort outside my opportunities, or my
      recollection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor's glance fell on Mrs. Petullo, but hers was not on him; she
      sought the eyes of the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame looks your way,&rdquo; he indicated, and at once the Chamberlain's
      visage changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd be better to look to her man,&rdquo; he said, so roughly that the Count
      once more had all his misgivings revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may not guess how bitter a prospect that may be,&rdquo; said he with pity
      for the creature, and he moved towards her, with the Chamberlain, of
      necessity, but with some reluctance, at his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo saw the lagging nature of her old love's advance; it was all
      that was needed now to make her evening horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, smiling, but still with other emotions than amusement or
      goodwill struggling in her countenance, &ldquo;I was just fancying you would be
      none the waur o' a wife to look to your buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buttons!&rdquo; repeated the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said, and lightly turned him round so that his back was shown,
      with his plaid no longer concealing the absence of a button from a skirt
      of his Highland jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor looked, and a rush of emotions fairly overwhelmed him, for he
      knew he had the missing button in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the nocturnal marauder of Doom, or the very devil was in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain laughed, but still betrayed a little confusion: Mrs.
      Petullo wondered at the anger of his eyes, and a moment later launched
      upon an abstracted minuet with Montaiglon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII &mdash; THE DUEL ON THE SANDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain stood near the door with his hand in the bosom of his
      coat, fingering the flageolet that was his constant companion even in the
      oddest circumstances, and Count Victor went up to him, the button
      concealed in his palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are for going?&rdquo; said Simon, more like one who puts a question
      than states a position, for some hours of Count Victor's studied contempt
      created misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Il y a terme à tout!</i> And possibly monsieur will do me the honour
      to accompany me so far as the avenue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known men whose reputations were mainly a matter of clothes.
      Monsieur is the first I have met whose character hung upon a single
      button. Permit me to return your button with a million regards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the silver lozenge out upon his open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many buttons alike,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain. Then he checked
      himself abruptly and&mdash;&ldquo;Well, damn it! I'll allow it's mine,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should expect just this charming degree of manly frankness from
      monsieur. A button is a button, too, and a devilish serious thing when,
      say, off a foil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still held out the accusation on his open hand, and bowed with his eyes
      on those of the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that MacTaggart lightly struck up the hand, and the button rolled
      twinkling along the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor glanced quickly round him to see that no one noticed. The
      hall, but for some domestics, was left wholly to themselves. The ball was
      over, the company had long gone, and he had managed to stay his own
      departure by an interest feigned in the old armour that hung, with all its
      gallant use accomplished, on the walls, followed by a game at cards with
      three of the ducal <i>entourage</i>, two of whom had just departed. The
      melancholy of early morning in a banquet-room had settled down, and all
      the candles guttered in the draught of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy monsieur will agree that this is a business calling for the open
      air,&rdquo; said Count Victor, no way disturbed by the rudeness. &ldquo;I abhor the
      stench of hot grease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;&rdquo; began the Chamberlain, and Count Victor interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is for reflection; to-day is for deeds. Look! it
      will be totally clear in a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the last man who would spoil the prospect of a ploy,&rdquo; said the
      Chamberlain, changing his Highland sword for one of the rapiers on the
      wall that was more in conformity with the Frenchman's weapon; &ldquo;and yet
      this is scarcely the way to find your Drimdarroch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais oui!</i> Our Drimdarroch can afford to wait his turn. Drimdarroch
      is wholly my affair; this is partly Doom's, though I, it seems, was made
      the poor excuse for your inexplicable insolence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain slightly started, turned away, and smiled. &ldquo;I was right,&rdquo;
       thought he. &ldquo;Here's a fellow credits himself with being the cause of
      jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; he said aloud at last, &ldquo;this way,&rdquo; and with the sword tucked
      under his arm he led, by a side-door in the turret-angle, into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor followed, stepping gingerly, for the snow was ankle-deep upon
      the lawn, and his red-heeled dancing-shoes were thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know we must all die,&rdquo; said he in a little, pausing with a shiver of
      cold, and a glance about that bleak grey garden&mdash;&ldquo;We know we must all
      die, but I have a preference for dying in dry hose, if die I must. Cannot
      monsieur suggest a more comfortable quarter for our little affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is not so dirty particular,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain. &ldquo;If I sink my
      own rheumatism, it is not too much for you to risk your hose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The main avenue&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is seen from every window of the ball-room, and the servants are still
      there. Here is a great to-do about nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still, monsieur, I must protest on behalf of my poor hose,&rdquo; said
      Count Victor, always smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! I could fight on my bare feet,&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, monsieur; but there is so much in custom, <i>n'est ce pas?</i>
      and my ancestors have always been used with boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain overlooked the irony and glanced perplexed about him.
      There was, obviously, no place near that was not open to the objection
      urged. Everywhere the snow lay deep on grass and pathway; the trees were
      sheeted ghosts, the chill struck through his own Highland brogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said he at last, with a sudden thought; &ldquo;the sand's the place,
      though it's a bit to go,&rdquo; and he led the way hurriedly towards the
      riverside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of us may go farther to-day and possibly fare worse,&rdquo; said Montaiglon
      with unwearied good-humour, stepping in his rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of the dawn. Already there was enough of it to show
      the world of hill and wood in vast, vague, silent masses, to render wan
      the flaming windows of the castle towers behind them. In the east a sullen
      sky was all blotched with crimson, some pine-trees on the heights were
      struck against it, intensely black, intensely melancholy, perhaps because
      they led the mind to dwell on wild, remote, and solitary places, the
      savagery of old forests, the cruel destiny of man, who has come after and
      must go before the dead things of the wood. There was no wind; the
      landscape swooned in frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith! 'tis an odd and dolorous world at six o'clock in the morning,&rdquo;
       thought Count Victor; &ldquo;I wish I were asleep in Cammercy and all well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young fallow-deer stood under an oak-tree, lifting its head to gaze
      without dismay, almost a phantom; every moment the dawn spread wider; at
      last the sea showed, leaden in the bay, mists revealed themselves upon Ben
      Ime. Of sound there was only the wearying plunge of the cascades and the
      roll of the shallows like tumbril-wheels on causeway as the river ran
      below the arches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far yet, monsieur?&rdquo; cried Count Victor to the figure striding ahead, and
      his answer came in curt accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be there in ten minutes. You want a little patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be there, <i>par dieu!</i> in time enough,&rdquo; cried out Count
      Victor. &ldquo;'Tis all one to me, but the march is pestilent dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! would ye have fiddlin' at a funeral?&rdquo; asked the Chamberlain, still
      without turning or slowing his step; and then, as though he had been
      inspired, he drew out the flageolet that was ever his bosom friend, and
      the astounded Frenchman heard the strains of a bagpipe march. It was so
      incongruous in the circumstances that he must laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were a thousand pities to kill so rare a personage,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and
      yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;'tis a villainous early morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed along the river-bank; they came upon the sea-beach; the
      Chamberlain put his instrument into his pocket and still led the way upon
      the sand that lay exposed far out by the low tide. He stopped at a spot
      clear of weed, flat and dry and firm almost as a table. It was the ideal
      floor for an engagement, but from the uncomfortable sense of espionage
      from the neighbourhood of a town that looked with all its windows upon the
      place as it were upon a scene in a play-house. The whole front of the town
      was not two hundred yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be disturbed here, monsieur,&rdquo; said Count Victor, hesitating as
      the other put off his plaid and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Sim MacTaggart shortly, tugging at a belt, and yet Count Victor
      had his doubts. He made his preparations, it is true, but always with an
      apprehensive look at that long line of sleeping houses, whose shutters&mdash;with
      a hole in the centre of each&mdash;seemed to stare down upon the sand. No
      smoke, no flames, no sign of human occupance was there: the sea-gull and
      the pigeon pecked together upon the door-steps or the window-sills, or
      perched upon the ridges of the high-pitched roofs, and a heron stalked at
      the outlet of a gutter that ran down the street. The sea, quiet and dull,
      the east turned from crimson to grey; the mountains streaming with mist&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cammercy after all!&rdquo; said Count Victor to himself; &ldquo;I shall wake in a
      moment, but yet for a nightmare 'tis the most extraordinary I have ever
      experienced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are a good Christian,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, ready first and
      waiting, bending his borrowed weapon in malignant arcs above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-fourths of one at least,&rdquo; said Montaiglon; &ldquo;for I try my best to be
      a decent man,&rdquo; and he daintily and deliberately turned up his sleeve upon
      an arm as white as milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm waiting,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! <i>en garde!</i>&rdquo; said his antagonist, throwing off his hat and
      putting up his weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tinkle of steel like the sound of ice afloat in a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town but seemed to sleep wholly; as it happened, there was one awake
      in it who had, of all its inhabitants, the most vital interest in this
      stern business out upon the sands. She had gone home from the ball rent
      with vexation and disappointment; her husband snored, a mannikin of
      parchment, jaundice-cheeked, scorched at the nose with snuff; and,
      shuddering with distaste of her cage and her companion, she sat long at
      the window, all her finery on, chasing dream with dream, and every dream,
      as she knew, alas! with the inevitable poignancy of waking to the truth.
      For her the flaming east was hell's own vestibule, for her the greying
      dawn was a pallor of the heart, the death of hope. She sat turning and
      turning the marriage-ring upon her finger, sometimes all unconsciously
      essaying to slip it off, and tugging viciously at the knuckle-joint that
      prevented its removal, and her eyes, heavy for sleep and moist with
      sorrow, still could pierce the woods of Shira Glen to their deep-most
      recesses and see her lover there. They roamed so eagerly, so hungrily into
      that far distance, that for a while she failed to see the figures on the
      nearer sand. They swam into her recognition like wraiths upsprung, as it
      were, from the sand itself or exhaled upon a breath from the sea: at first
      she could not credit her vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not with her eyes&mdash;those tear-blurred eyes&mdash;she knew him;
      it was by the inner sense, the nameless one that lovers know; she felt the
      tale in a thud of the heart and ran out with &ldquo;Sim!&rdquo; shrieked on her dumb
      lips. Her gown trailed in the pools and flicked up the ooze of weed and
      sand; a shoulder bared itself; some of her hair took shame and covered it
      with a veil of dull gold.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII &mdash; THE DUEL ON THE SANDS&mdash;Continued.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now it was clear day. The lime-washed walls of the town gleamed in
      sunshine, and the shadows of the men at war upon the sand stretched far
      back from their feet toward the white land. Birds twittered, and shook the
      snow from the shrubbery of the Duke's garden; the river cried below the
      arches, but not loud enough to drown the sound of stumbling steps, and
      Montaiglon threw a glance in the direction whence they came, even at the
      risk of being spitted on his opponent's weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He parried a thrust in quarte and cried, &ldquo;Stop! stop! <i>Remettez-vous,
      monsieur!</i> Here comes a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain looked at the dishevelled figure running awkwardly over
      the rough stones and slimy weeds, muttered an oath, and put his point up
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we'll have the whole town about our lugs in ten
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lady?&rdquo; said Count Victor, guarding under protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only Kate,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, and aimed a furious thrust in
      tierce. Montaiglon parried by a beat of the edge of his forte, and forced
      the blade upwards. He could have disarmed by the simplest trick of Girard,
      but missed the opportunity from an insane desire to save his opponent's
      feelings in the presence of a spectator. Yet the leniency cost them dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sim! Sim!&rdquo; cried out the woman in a voice full of horror and entreaty,
      panting towards the combatants. Her call confused her lover: in a mingling
      of anger and impatience he lunged wildly, and Count Victor's weapon took
      him in the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zut!&rdquo; cried the Frenchman, withdrawing the sword and flicking the blood
      from the point with a ludicrous movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain writhed at his feet, muttered something fierce in Gaelic,
      and a great repugnance took possession of the other. He looked at his
      work; he quite forgot the hurrying woman until she ran past him and threw
      herself beside the wounded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sim! Sim!&rdquo; she wailed, in an utterance the most distressing. Her
      lover turned upon his back and smiled sardonically at her out of a face of
      paper. &ldquo;I wish ye had been a little later, Kate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or that I had
      begun with a hale arm. Good God! I've swallowed a hot cinder. I love you,
      my dear; I love you, my dear. Oh, where the de'il's my flageolet?&rdquo; And
      then his head fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      With frantic hands she unloosed his cravat, sought and staunched the wound
      with her handkerchief, and wept the while with no sound, though her bosom,
      white like the spray of seas, seemed bound to burst above her corsage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor sheathed his weapon, and &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he with preposterous
      inadequacy, &ldquo;this&mdash;this&mdash;is distressing; this&mdash;this&mdash;&rdquo;
       he desired to offer some assistance, but baulked at the fury of the eyes
      she turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you!&mdash;you!&mdash;you!&rdquo; she gasped, choking to say even so
      little. &ldquo;It is enough, is it not, that you have murdered him, without
      staying to see me tortured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this he could, of course, make no reply. His quandary was immense. Two
      hundred yards away was that white phantom town shining in the morning sun
      that rose enormous over the eastern hills beyond the little lapping silver
      waves. A phantom town, with phantom citizens doubtless prying through the
      staring eyes of those closed shutters. A phantom town&mdash;town of fairy
      tale, with grotesque roofs, odd <i>corbeau</i>-stepped gables, smokeless
      chimneys, all white with snow, and wild birds on its terrace, preening in
      the blessed light of the sun. He stood with his back to the pair upon the
      sand. &ldquo;My God! 'tis a dream,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall laugh in a moment.&rdquo; He
      seemed to himself to stand thus an age, and yet in truth it was only a
      pause of minutes when the Chamberlain spoke with the tone of sleep and
      insensibility as from another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, my dear; I love you, my dear&mdash;Olivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo gave a cry of pain and staggered to her feet. She turned upon
      Count Victor a face distraught and eyes that were wild with the
      wretchedness of the disillusioned. Her fingers were playing nervously at
      her lips; her shoulders were roughened and discoloured by the cold; her
      hair falling round her neck gave her the aspect of a slattern. She, too,
      looked at the façade of the town and saw her husband's windows shuttered
      and indifferent to her grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whether you have killed him or not,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;It
      does not matter&mdash;oh! it matters all&mdash;no, no, it does not matter&mdash;Oh!
      could you not&mdash;could you not kill me too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For his life he could not have answered: he but looked at her in mortal
      pity, and at that she ground her teeth and struck him on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awake, decidedly awake!&rdquo; he said, and shrugged his shoulders; and then
      for the first time he saw that she was shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will die of cold: permit me,&rdquo; and he stooped and
      picked up his coat from the sand and placed it without resistance on her
      shoulders, like a cloak. She drew it, indeed, about her with trembling
      fingers as if her senses craved the comfort though her detestation of the
      man who gave it was great. But in truth she was demented now, forgetting
      even the bleeding lover. She gave little paces on the sand, with one of
      her shoes gone from her feet, and wrung her hands and sobbed miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor bent to the wounded man and found him regaining
      consciousness. He did what he could, though that of necessity was little,
      to hasten his restoration, and relinquished the office only when
      approaching footsteps on the shore made him look up to see a group of
      workmen hastening to the spot where the Chamberlain lay on the edge of the
      tide and the lady and the foreigner beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man killed him,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Petullo, pointing an accusing finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have not killed him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and in any case it was an
      honourable engagement; but that matters little at this moment when the
      first thing to do is to have him removed home. So far as I am concerned, I
      promise you I shall be quite ready to go with you and see him safely
      lodged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the wounded man was borne through the lodge gate with Count Victor,
      coatless, in attendance, the latter looked back and saw Mrs. Petullo,
      again bare-shouldered, standing before her husband's door and gazing after
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her temper had come back; she had thrown his laced coat into the
      approaching sea!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX &mdash; THE CELL IN THE FOSSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      By this time the morning was well gone; the town had wakened to the day's
      affairs&mdash;a pleasant light grey reek with the acrid odour of burning
      wood soaring from chimneys into a sky intensely blue; and the roads that
      lay interlaced and spacious around the castle of Argyll were&mdash;not
      thronged, but busy at least with labouring folk setting out upon their
      duties. To them, meeting the wounded form of the Chamberlain, the hour was
      tragic, and figured long at fireside stories after, acutely memorable for
      years. They passed astounded or turned to follow him, making their own
      affairs secondary to their interest in the state of one who, it was
      obvious even to Montaiglon, was deep in their affections. He realised that
      a few leagues farther away from the seat of a Justiciary-General it might
      have gone ill with the man who had brought Simon MacTaggart to this
      condition, for menacing looks were thrown at him, and more than once there
      was a significant gesture that made plain the animosity with which he was
      regarded. An attempt to escape&mdash;if such had occurred to him&mdash;would
      doubtless have been attended by the most serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argyll met his Chamberlain with the signs of genuine distress: it was
      touching, indeed, to see his surrender to the most fraternal feeling, and
      though for a while the Duke's interest in his Chamberlain left him
      indifferent to him who was the cause of it, Count Victor could not but
      perceive that he was himself in a position of exceeding peril. He
      remembered the sinister comments of the Baron of Doom upon the hazards of
      an outsider's entrance to the boar's cave, and realised for the first time
      what that might mean in this country, where the unhappy wretch from Appin,
      whose case had some resemblance to his own, had been remorselessly made
      the victim (as the tale went) to world-old tribal jealousies whose
      existence was incredible to all outside the Highland line. In the chill
      morning air he stood, coatless and shivering, the high embrasured walls
      lifting above him, the jabbering menials of the castle grouped a little
      apart, much of the language heard savage and incomprehensible in his ears,
      himself, as it were, of no significance to any one except the law that was
      to manifest itself at any moment. Last night it had been very gay in this
      castle, the Duke was the most gracious of hosts; here, faith! was a vast
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have a coat?&rdquo; he asked a bystander, taking advantage of a bustle in
      the midst of which the wounded man was taken into the castle. He got the
      answer of a scullion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A coat!&rdquo; exclaimed the man he addressed. &ldquo;A rope's more like it.&rdquo; And so,
      Count Victor, shrugging his shoulders at this impertinence, was left to
      suffer the air that bit him to the marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain disposed of, and in the leech's hands, Argyll had the
      Frenchman brought to his rooms, still in his shirt-sleeves. The weapon of
      his offence was yet in his hand for evidence, had that been wanting, of an
      act he was prepared to admit with frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur Montaiglon,&rdquo; said his Grace, pacing nervously up and down
      the room before him, &ldquo;this is a pretty matter. You have returned to see my
      pictures somewhat sooner than I had looked for, and in no very ceremonious
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the Count, with a difficult essay at meeting the man in his
      own humour&mdash;&ldquo;Truly, but your Grace's invitation was so pressing&mdash;<i>ah!
      c'est grand dommage! mais&mdash;mais</i>&mdash;I am not, with every
      consideration, in the key for badinage. M. le Duc, you behold me
      exceedingly distressed at the discommoding of your household. At your age
      this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled himself up, confused a little, aware that his customary
      politeness had somehow for once shamefully deserted him with no intention
      on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to put the case with exceeding delicacy,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;At my
      age, as you have said, my personal inconvenience is of little importance
      in face of the fact that a dear friend of mine may be at death's door. At
      all events there is a man, if signs mislead me not, monstrously near death
      under this roof, a man well liked by all that know him, a strong man and a
      brave man, and a man, in his way, of genius. He goes out, as I say, hale
      and hearty, and comes back bloody in your company. You came to this part
      of the world, monsieur, with the deliberate intention of killing my
      Chamberlain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's as Heaven, which arranges these things without consulting us, may
      have decided, my lord; on my honour, I had much preferred never to have
      set eyes on your Chamberlain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said the Duke with a high head and slapping with open hand
      the table beside him&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come! I am not a fool, Montaiglon&mdash;even
      at my age. You deliberately sought this unfortunate man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur the Duke of Argyll has my word that it was not so,&rdquo; said the
      Count softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy in that case, then, you had found him easy to avoid,&rdquo; said the
      Duke, who was in an ir-restrainable heat. &ldquo;From the first&mdash;oh, come!
      sir, let us not be beating about the bush, and let us sink all these
      evasions&mdash;from the first you have designed a meeting with MacTaggart,
      and your every act since you came to this country has led up to this
      damned business that is likely to rob me of the bravest of servants. It
      was not the winds of heaven that blew you against your will into this part
      of Scotland, and brought you in contact with my friend on the very first
      night of your coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still, M. le Duc, with infinite deference, and a coolness that is
      partly due to the unpleasant fact (as you may perceive) that I have no
      coat on, 'twas quite the other way, and your bravest of servants thrust
      himself upon my attention that had otherwise been directed to the real
      object of my being in Scotland at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke gave a gesture of impatience. &ldquo;I am not at the heart of these
      mysteries,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but&mdash;even at my age&mdash;I know a great deal
      more about this than you give me credit for. If it is your whim to affect
      that this wretched business was no more than a passage between gentlemen,
      the result of a quarrel over cards or the like in my house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the Count, &ldquo;there I am all to blame. Our affair ought more
      properly to have opened elsewhere. In that detail your Grace has every
      ground for complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a mere side affair,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;and something else more
      closely affects me. I am expected to accept it, then, that the Comte de
      Mont-aiglon, travelling incognito in the unassuming <i>rôle</i> of a wine
      merchant, came here at this season simply from a passion for our Highland
      scenery. I had not thought the taste for dreary mountains and black glens
      had extended to the Continent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least 'twas not to quarrel with a servant I came here,&rdquo; retorted Count
      Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is ill said, sir,&rdquo; said his Grace. &ldquo;My kinsman has ten generations
      of ancestry of the best blood of Scotland and the Isles underground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that, M. le Duc, there is an obvious and ancient retort&mdash;that
      therein he is like a potato plant; the best of him is buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll stood before the Frenchman dubious and embarrassed; vexed at the
      tone of the encounter, and convinced, for reasons of his own, that in one
      particular at least the foreigner prevaricated, yet impressed by the manly
      front of the gentleman whose affair had brought a morning's tragedy so
      close upon the heels of an evening's mirth. Here was the sort of quandary
      in which he would naturally have consulted with his Duchess, but it was no
      matter to wake a woman to, and she was still in her bed-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assume you look for this unhappy business to be treated as an affair of
      honour?&rdquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So to call it,&rdquo; replied Count Victor, &ldquo;though in truth, the honour, on my
      word, was all on one side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in doubtful taste to put it quite in these terms,&rdquo; said the Duke
      more sternly, &ldquo;particularly as you are the one to come out of it so far
      scathless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would M. le Duc know how his servant compelled my&mdash;my attentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compelled your attentions! I do not like the tone of your speeches,
      monsieur. Dignity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> M. le Duc, would you expect a surfeit of dignity from a
      man without a jacket?&rdquo; said the Count, looking pathetically at his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dignity&mdash;I mean the sense of it&mdash;would dictate a more sober
      carriage in face of the terrible act you have committed. I am doing my
      best to find the slightest excuse for you, because you are a stranger
      here, a man of good family though engaged upon a stupendous folly, and I
      have before now been in the reverence of your people. You ask me if I know
      what compelled your attention (as you say) to my Chamberlain, and I will
      answer you frankly that I know all that is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that the Count was visibly amazed. This was, indeed, to put a new face
      on matters and make more regrettable his complacent surrender after his
      affair on the sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, M. le Duc,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no more to be said. I
      protest I am unable to comprehend your Grace's complacence towards a rogue&mdash;even
      of your own household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll rang a bell and concluded the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been enough of this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fear you do not clearly
      realise all the perils of your situation. You came here&mdash;you will
      pardon a man at my age insisting upon it, for I know the facts&mdash;with
      the set design of challenging one who properly or improperly has aroused
      your passion; you have accomplished your task, and must not consider
      yourself harshly treated if you have to pay the possible penalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, M. le Duc, it is not so, always with infinite deference, and
      without a coat as I have had the boldness to remark before: my task had
      gone on gaily enough had your Monsieur MacTaggart not been the victim of
      some inexplicable fever&mdash;unless as I sometimes suspect it were a
      preposterous jealousy that made me the victim of his somewhat stupid folly
      play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have accomplished your task, as I say,&rdquo; proceeded Argyll, heedless of
      the interruption, &ldquo;and to tell the truth, the thing has been done with an
      unpardonably primitive absence of form. I am perhaps an indifferent judge
      of such ceremonies; at my age&mdash;as you did me the honour to put it&mdash;that
      is only to be expected, but we used, when I was younger, to follow a
      certain formula in inviting our friend the enemy out to be killed. What is
      this hasty and clandestine encounter before the law of the land but a
      deliberate attempt at murder? It would be so even in your own country
      under the circumstances. M. le Comte, where were your seconds? Your
      wine-selling has opened in villainously bad circumstances, and you are in
      error to assume that the details of the code may be waived even among the
      Highland hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this gentleman to the fosse,&rdquo; said the Duke, with the ring of steel
      in his voice and his eyes snapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least there is as little form about my incarceration as about my poor
      duel,&rdquo; said Count Victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father would have been somewhat more summary in circumstances like
      these,&rdquo;, said the Duke, &ldquo;and, by Heaven! the old style had its merits too;
      but these are different days, though, if I were you, I fancy I'd prefer
      the short shrift of Long David the dempster to the felon's cell. Be good
      enough to leave your sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor said never a word, but placed the weapon in a corner of the
      room, made a deep <i>congé</i>, and went forth a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last few minutes of the interview he had forgotten the cold, but
      now when he was led into the open air he felt it in his coatless condition
      more poignant than his apprehension at his position otherwise. He shivered
      as he walked along the fosse, through which blew a shrewd north wind,
      driving the first flakes of an approaching snowstorm. The fosse was wide
      and deep, girding the four-square castle, mantled on its outer walls by
      dense ivy, where a few birds twittered. The wall was broken at intervals
      by the doors of what might very well serve as cells if cells were wanted,
      and it was to one of these that Count Victor found himself consigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My faith, Victor, thou art a fool of the first water!&rdquo; he said to himself
      as he realised the ignominy of his situation. For he was in the most
      dismal of dungeons, furnished as scantily as a cellar, fireless, damp, and
      almost in sepulchral darkness, for what light might have entered by a
      little window over the door was obscured by drifted snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by his eyes became accustomed to the obscurity, and he concluded
      that he was in what had at one time been a wine-cellar, as bottles were
      racked against the back wall of his arched apartment. They were empty&mdash;he
      confirmed his instinct on that point quickly enough, for the events of the
      morning left him in the mood for refreshment. It was uncomfortable all
      this; there was always the possibility of justice miscarried; but at no
      time had he any fear of savage reprisals such as had alarmed him when
      Mungo Boyd locked him up in Doom and the fictitious broken clan cried
      &ldquo;Loch Sloy!&rdquo; in darkness. For this was not wholly the wilds, and Argyll's
      manner, though stern, was that of one who desired in all circumstances to
      be just.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Count Victor sat on a box and shivered in his shirt-sleeves and
      fervently wished for breakfast. The snow fell heavily now, and drifted in
      the fosse and whitened the world; outside, therefore, all was silent;
      there must be bustle and footsteps, but here they were unheard: it seemed
      in a while that he was buried in catacombs, an illusion so vexatious that
      he felt he must dispel it at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one way to do so. He stood on his box and tried to reach the
      window over his door. To break the glass was easy, but when that was done
      and the snow was cleared away by his hand, he could see out only by
      pulling himself up with an awkward and exhausting grasp on the narrow
      ledge. Thus he secured but the briefest of visions of what was outside,
      and that was not a reassuring one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he meditated escape from the window, he must now abandon it; for on
      the other side of the ditch, cowering in the shelter of one of the castle
      doors, was standing one of the two men who had placed him in the cell,
      there apparently for no other purpose than to keep an eye on the only
      possible means of exit from the discarded wine-cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breaking glass was unheard by the watcher; at all events he made no
      movement to suggest that he had observed it, and he said nothing about it
      when some time later in the forenoon he came with Count Victor's
      breakfast, which was generous enough to confirm his belief that in
      Argyll's hands he was at least assured of the forms of justice, though
      that, in truth, was not the most consoling of prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      His warder was a dumb dog, a squint-eyed Cerberus with what Count Victor
      for once condemned as a tribal gibberish for his language, so that he was
      incapable of understanding what was said to him even if he had been
      willing to converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is little good to play the guitar to an ass,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, and
      fell to his viands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX &mdash; A DUCAL DISPUTATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Count Victor, buried among cobwebs in the fosse, stung by cold till he
      shivered as in a quartan ague, suffering alternately the chagrin of the
      bungler self-discovered and the apprehension of a looming fate whose
      nature could only be guessed at, was in a state unenviable, Argyll himself
      was scarcely less unhappy. It was not only that his Chamberlain's
      condition grieved him, but that the whole affair put him in a quandary
      where the good citizen quarrelled in him with another old Highland
      gentleman whose code of morals was not in strict accord with written
      statutes. He had studied the Pandects at Utrecht, but also he had been
      young there, and there was a place (if all tales be true) on the banks of
      the Yssel River where among silent polders a young Scot had twice at least
      fought with the sword upon some trivial matter of debate with
      Netherlanders of his college. And then he knew his Chamberlain. About
      Simon MacTaggart Argyll had few illusions, though they perhaps made all
      the difference in his conduct to the gentleman in question. That
      MacTaggart should have brought upon himself a tardy retribution for acts
      more bold than scrupulous was not to be wondered at; that the meeting with
      Count Victor was honourably conducted, although defective in its form, was
      almost certain; but here the assailant was in his custody, and whether he
      liked it or not he must hand him over to the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impulse had been to wash his hands of all complicity in the
      Frenchman's fate by sending him straightway to the common town tolbooth,
      pending his trial in the ordinary course; but he hesitated from an
      intuition that the step would find no favour in the eyes of his Duchess,
      who had her own odd prejudices regarding Sim MacTaggart, and an interest
      in Count Victor none the less ardent because it was but a day or two old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man! Archie, every bit of him!&rdquo; she had said at the conclusion of last
      evening's entertainment; and though without depreciating his visitor he
      had attempted to convince her that her estimate ran the risk of being
      prejudiced by her knowledge of the quixotic mission the foreigner was
      embarked on, she had refused to see in Count Victor's accent, face, and
      carriage anything but the most adorable character. She ever claimed a
      child's attribute of attraction or repulsion on mere instinct to and from
      men's mere exteriors, and her husband knew it was useless to expect any
      approval from her for any action that might savour of the slightest
      harshness to the foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But above all he feared&mdash;he dreaded&mdash;something else. Simon
      MacTaggart was to him more than a servant; he knew many of his failings,
      but seemed to tolerate them because he also, like Count Victor, had
      learned not to expect too much from human nature. But it was ever his fear
      that his lenience for the sins and follies of his Chamberlain would some
      day suffer too hard a strain, and lead to that severance that in the case
      of old friends and familiars was his Grace's singular terror in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed heavily for Argyll. Many a time he looked out of his window
      into the fosse slow drifting full of snow; and though he could not from
      that point see the cell-door of his prisoner, his fancy did enough to feed
      his unhappiness. Vainly he paced his library, vainly sought the old
      anodyne&mdash;the blessed anodyne of books; he was consumed with
      impatience to consult with his wife, and she, fragile always, and fatigued
      by last evening's gaieties, was still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went for the twentieth time into the room where the Chamberlain was
      lying. The doctor, a lank, pock-pitted embodiment of mad chirurgy from
      books and antique herbal delusions inherited from generations of simple
      healers, mixed noxious stuff in a gallipot and plumed himself upon some
      ounces of gore drawn from his victim. Clysters he prated on; electuaries;
      troches; the weed that the Gael of him called <i>slanlus</i> or
      &ldquo;heal-all;&rdquo; of unguents loathsomely compounded, but at greatest length and
      with fullest rapture of his vile phlebotomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six ounces, your Grace!&rdquo; he cried gleefully, in a laughable high
      falsetto, holding up the bowl with trembling fingers as if he proffered
      for the ducal cheer the very flagon of Hebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argyll shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to God, Dr. Madver,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your practice in this matter of
      blood-letting may not be so much infernal folly. Why! the man lost all he
      could spare before he reached you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there, unconscious, Simon MacTaggart slept, pale as parchment, fallen
      in at the jaw, twitching a little now and then at the corners of the
      mouth, otherwise inert and dead. Never before had his master seen him off
      his guard&mdash;never, that is to say, without the knowledge that he was
      being looked at&mdash;and if his Grace had expected that he should find
      any grosser man than he knew revealed, he was mistaken. 'Twas a child that
      slept&mdash;a child not unhappy, at most only indifferent to everything
      with that tremendous naïveté of the dead and of the soundly sleeping&mdash;that
      great carelessness that comes upon the carcass when the soul's from home.
      If he had sinned a million times,&mdash;let the physiognomists say what
      they will!&mdash;not a line upon his face betrayed him, for there the
      ideals only leave their mark, and his were forever impeccable.
    </p>
    <p>
      His coat hung upon the back of a chair, and his darling flageolet had
      fallen out of the pocket and lay upon the floor. Argyll picked it up and
      held it in his hand a while, looking upon it with a little Contempt, and
      yet with some kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy that!&rdquo; he said more to himself than to the apothecary; &ldquo;the poor
      fellow must have his flageloet with him even upon an affair of this kind.
      It beats all! My dear man of moods! my good vagabond! my windlestraw of
      circumstance! constant only to one ideal&mdash;the unattainable perfection
      in a kind of roguish art. To play a perfect tune in the right spirit he
      would sacrifice everything, and yet drift carelessly into innumerable
      disgraces for mere lack of will to lift a hand. I daresay sometimes Jean
      is in the rights of it after all&mdash;his gifts have been his curse;
      wanting his skill of this simple instrument that was for ever to himself
      and others an intoxication, and wanting his outward pleasing form, he had
      been a good man to the very marrow. A good man! H'm! Ay! and doubtless an
      uninteresting one. Doctor! doctor! have you any herb for the eyesight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your Grace have a dimness? I know a lotion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dimness! faith! it is the common disease, and I suffer it with the rest.
      Sometimes I cannot see the length of my nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stomach, your Grace; just the stomach,&rdquo; cried the poor leech. &ldquo;My own
      secret preparation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own secret preparation, doctor, will not, I am sure, touch the root
      of this complaint or the devil himself is in it. I can still see&mdash;even
      at my age&mdash;the deer on Tom-a-chrochair, and read the scurviest
      letters my enemies send me, but my trouble is that I cannot understand the
      flageolet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flageolet, your Grace,&rdquo; said MacIver bewildered. &ldquo;I thought you spoke
      of your eyesight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I did. I cannot see through the mysteries of things; I cannot
      understand why man should come into the world with fingers so apt to
      fankle that he cannot play the finest tunes all the time and in the best
      of manners. These, however, are but idle speculations, beyond the noble
      jurisdiction of the chymist. And so you think our patient will make a good
      recovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With care, your Grace; and the constant use of my styptic, a most elegant
      nostrum, your Grace, that has done wonders in the case of a widow up the
      glen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This folly of a thing they call one's honour,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;has made a
      great deal of profitable trade for your profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no cause of complaint, your Grace,&rdquo; said the doctor complacently,
      &ldquo;except that nowadays honour nor nothing else rarely sends so nice a case
      of hemorrhage my way. An inch or two to the left and Mr. MacTaggart would
      have lifted his last rents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Argyll grimaced with distaste at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Sim!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And my tenants would have lost a tolerable agent,
      though I might easily find one to get more money out of them. Condemn that
      Frenchman! I wish the whole race of them were at the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could never have been a fair fight this,&rdquo; said the doctor, spreading a
      plaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never <i>was</i> a fair fight,&rdquo; said Argyll, &ldquo;or but rarely, and
      then neither of the men was left to tell the tale. The man with most
      advantages must ever win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other had them all here,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;for the Chamberlain was
      fighting with an unhealed wound in his right arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wounded arm!&rdquo; cried Argyll. &ldquo;I never heard of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a wound so recent, the doctor pointed out, that it made the duel
      madness. He turned over the neck of his patient's shirt and showed the
      cicatrice, angry and ugly. &ldquo;A stab, too!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stab?&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stab with a knife or a thrust with a sword,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;It has
      gone clean through the arm and come out at the back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! this is news indeed! What does it mean? It's the reason for the
      pallour and the abstraction of some days back, for which I put the blame
      upon some love-affair of his. He never breathed a word of it to me, nor I
      suppose to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has had no attention from me or any one else,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;but
      the wound seems to have healed of itself so far without anything being
      done for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that a styptic&mdash;even the famous styptic&mdash;can do no more
      wonders than a good constitution after all. Poor Sim, I wonder what folly
      this came of. And yet&mdash;to look at him there&mdash;his face so gentle,
      his brow so calm, his mouth&mdash;ah, poor Sim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From a distant part of the house a woman's voice arose, crying, &ldquo;Archie,
      Archi-e-e!&rdquo; in a lingering crescendo: it was the Duchess, and as yet she
      had not heard of the day's untoward happenings. He went out and told her
      gently. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he went on when her agitation had abated, &ldquo;what of our
      Chevalier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what of him? I hope he is not to suffer for this,
      seeing MacTaggart is going to get better, for I should dearly like to have
      him get some return for his quest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, indeed?&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; and stared at her. &ldquo;The Count
      is at this moment cooling his heels in the fosse cell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hard!&rdquo; said she, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would you, my dear? I am still as much the representative of the
      law as ever, and am I to connive at such outrages under my own windows
      because the chief offender is something of a handsome young gentleman who
      has the tact to apologise for a disturbance in my domestic affairs that
      must, as he puts it, be disconcerting to a man at my age? A man of my age&mdash;there's
      France!&mdash;<i>toujours la politesse</i>, if you please! At my age!
      Confound his impudence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess could not suppress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his age, my dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you had the tact to put so obvious a
      thing differently or leave it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I heed his impudence,&rdquo; said the Duke hastily; &ldquo;that a man is no
      longer young at sixty is the most transparent of facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only he does not care to have it mentioned too unexpectedly. Oh, you
      goose!&rdquo; And she laughed outright, then checked herself at the recollection
      of the ailing Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I would believe myself as young as ever I was, my dear lass,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;credit me it is that it is more to seem so in the eyes of yourself,&rdquo; and
      he put his arm around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still,&rdquo; said she after a little&mdash;&ldquo;still the unlucky Frenchman is
      in the fosse more for his want of tact, I fear, than for his crime against
      the law of the land. Who pinked&mdash;if that's the nasty word&mdash;who
      pinked the Dutchman in Utrecht?&mdash;that's what I should like to know,
      my dear Justice Shallow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is different, though; he came here for the express purpose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of quarrelling with the Chamberlain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of quarrelling with somebody, as you know,&rdquo; said the nobleman
      hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for MacTaggart,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;really sorry, but I cannot
      pretend to believe he has been very ill done by&mdash;I mean unjustly done
      by. I am sure my Frenchman must have had some provocation, and is really
      the victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;that is we&mdash;know nothing about that, my dear,&rdquo; said
      Argyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot be mistaken; you would be the first at any other time to admit
      that I could tell whether a man was good or evil on a very brief
      acquaintance. With every regard for your favour to the Chamberlain, I
      cannot stand the man. If my instinct did not tell me he was vicious, my
      ears would, for I hear many stories little to his credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet a brave man, goodwife, a faithful servant and an interesting
      fellow. Come now! Jean, is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She merely smiled, patting his ruffles with delicate fondling fingers. It
      was never her habit to argue with her Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried smilingly, &ldquo;none of that, but contradict me if you dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never contradict his Grace the Duke of Argyll,&rdquo; said she, stepping back
      and sweeping the floor with her gown in a stately courtesy; &ldquo;it is not
      right, and it is not good for him&mdash;at his age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you rogue!&rdquo; he cried, laughing. &ldquo;But soberly now, you are too hard on
      poor Sim. It is the worst&mdash;the only vice of good women that they have
      no charity left for the imperfect either of their own sex or of mine. Let
      us think what an atom of wind-blown dust is every human being at the best,
      bad or good in his blood as his ancestry may have been, kind or cruel,
      straight or crooked, pious or pagan, admirable or evil, as the accidents
      of his training or experience shall determine. As I grow older I grow more
      tolerant, for I have learned that my own scanty virtues and graces are no
      more my own creation than the dukedom I came into from my father&mdash;or
      my red hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not red, Archie,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;not red, but reddish fair; in fact,
      a golden;&rdquo; and she gently pulled a curl upon his temple. &ldquo;What about our
      Frenchman? Is he to lie in the fosse till the Sheriff sends for him or
      till the great MacCailen Mor has forgiven him for telling him he was a
      little over the age of thirty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For once, my dear, you cannot have your way,&rdquo; said the Duke firmly. &ldquo;Be
      reasonable! We could not tolerate so scandalous an affair without some
      show of law and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerate!&rdquo; said the Duchess. &ldquo;You are very hard on poor Montaiglon,
      Archie, and all because he fought a duel with a doubtful gentleman who
      will be little the worse for it in a week or two. Let us think,&rdquo; she went
      on banteringly&mdash;&ldquo;let us think what an atom of wind-blown dust is
      every human being at the best, admirable or evil as his training&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband stopped her with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that, Jean; the man must thole his trial, for I have gone too
      far to draw back even if I had the will to humour you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one tone of her husband's his wife knew too decisive for her
      contending with, and now she heard it. Like a wise woman, she made up her
      mind to say no more, and she was saved an awkward pause by an uproar in
      the fosse. Up to the window where those two elderly lovers had their
      kindly disputation came the sound of cries. Out into the dusk of the
      evening Argyll thrust his head and asked an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Frenchman's gone!&rdquo; cried somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew in his head, with a smile struggling on his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You witch!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must have your own way with me, even if it
      takes a spell!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI &mdash; FLIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long after, when Count Victor Jean de Montaiglon was come into great good
      fortune, and sat snug by charcoal-fires in the chateau that bears his
      name, and stands, an edifice even the Du Barry had the taste to envy, upon
      the gusset of the roads which break apart a league to the south of the
      forest of Saint Germain-en-Laye, he would recount, with oddly inconsistent
      humours of mirth and tense dramatics, the manner of his escape from the
      cell in the fosse of the great MacCailen. And always his acutest memory
      was of the whipping rigour of the evening air, his temporary sense of
      swooning helplessness upon the verge of the fantastic wood. &ldquo;Figure you!
      Charles,&rdquo; would he say, &ldquo;the thin-blooded wand of forty years ago in a
      brocaded waistcoat and a pair of dancing-shoes seeking his way through a
      labyrinth of demoniac trees, shivering half with cold and half with terror
      like a <i>forcat</i> from the <i>bagne</i> of Toulouse, only that he knew
      not particularly from what he fled nor whereto his unlucky footsteps
      should be turned. I have seen it often since&mdash;the same place&mdash;have
      we not, <i>mignonne?</i>&mdash;and I avow 'tis as sweet and friendly a
      spot as any in our own neighbourhood; but then in that pestilent night of
      black and grey I was like a child, tenanting every tiny thicket with the
      were-wolf and the sheeted spectre. There is a stupid feeling comes to
      people sometimes in the like circumstances, that they are dead, that they
      have turned the key in the lock of life, as we say, and gone in some
      abstraction into the territory of shades. 'Twas so I felt, messieurs, and
      if in truth the ultimate place of spirits is so mortal chilly, I shall ask
      Père Antoine to let me have a greatcoat as well as the viaticum ere
      setting out upon the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been an insufferably cruel day, indeed, for Count Victor in his
      cell had he not one solace, so purely self-wrought, so utterly fanciful,
      that it may seem laughable. It was that the face of Olivia came before him
      at his most doleful moments&mdash;sometimes unsought by his imagination,
      though always welcome; with its general aspect of vague sweet sadness
      played upon by fleeting smiles, her lips desirable to that degree he could
      die upon them in one wild ecstasy, her eyes for depth and purity the very
      mountain wells. She lived, breathed, moved, smiled, sighed in this same
      austere atmosphere under the same grey sky that hung low outside his cell;
      the same snowfall that he could catch a glimpse of through the tiny space
      above his door was seen by her that moment in Doom; she must be taking the
      flavour of the sea as he could sometimes do in blessed moments even in
      this musty <i>oubliette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed, a short day with the dusk coming on as suddenly as if some
      one had drawn a curtain hurriedly over the tiny aperture above the door.
      And all the world outside seemed wrapped in silence. Twice again his
      warder came dumbly serving a meal, otherwise the prisoner might have been
      immeasurably remote from any life and wholly forgotten. There was, besides
      his visions of Olivia, one other thing to comfort him; it was when he
      heard briefly from some distant part of the castle the ululation of a
      bagpipe playing an air so jocund that it assured him at all events the
      Chamberlain was not dead, and was more probably out of danger. And then
      the cold grew intense beyond his bearance, and he reflected upon some
      method of escape if it were to secure him no more than exercise for
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window was out of the question, for in all probability the watch was
      still on the other side of the fosse&mdash;a tombstone for steadfastness
      and constancy. Count Victor could not see him now even by standing on his
      box and looking through the aperture, yet he gained something, he gained
      all, indeed, so pregnant a thing is accident&mdash;even the cosy
      charcoal-fires and the friends about him in the chateau near Saint
      Germain-en-Laye&mdash;by his effort to pierce the dusk and see across the
      ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as he was standing on the box, widening softly the aperture in the
      drifted snow upon the little window-ledge, he became conscious of cold air
      in a current beating upon the back of his head. The draught, that should
      surely be entering, was blowing out!
    </p>
    <p>
      At once he thought of a chimney, but there was no fireplace in his cell.
      Yet the air must be finding entrance elsewhere more freely than from the
      window. Perplexity mastered him for a little, and then he concluded that
      the current could come from nowhere else than behind the array of
      marshalled empty bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tonnerre!</i>&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;I have begun my career as wine
      merchant rather late in life or I had taken more interest in these dead
      gentlemen. <i>Avancez, donc, mes princes!</i> your ancient spirit once
      made plain the vacancies in the heads of his Grace's guests; let us see if
      now you do not conceal some holes that were for poor Montaiglon's profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One by one he pulled them out of their positions until he could intrude a
      sensitive hand behind the shelves where they had been racked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an airy space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Très bon! merci, messieurs les cadavres</i>, perhaps I may forgive you
      even yet for being empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hope surged, he wrought eagerly; before long he had cleared away a passage&mdash;that
      ended in a dead wall!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps the most poignant moment of his experience. He had, then,
      been the fool of an illusion! Only a blank wall! His fingers searched
      every inch of it within reach, but came upon nothing but masonry, cold,
      clammy, substantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A delusion after all!&rdquo; he said, bitterly disappointed. &ldquo;A delusion, and
      not the first that has been at the bottom of a bottle of wine.&rdquo; He had
      almost resigned himself again to his imprisonment when the puffing current
      of colder air than that stagnant within the cell struck him for the second
      time, more keenly felt than before, because he was warm with his
      exertions. This time he felt that it had come from somewhere over the
      level of his head. Back he dragged his box and stood upon it behind the
      bottle-bin, and felt higher upon the wall than he could do standing, to
      discover that it stopped short about nine feet from the floor, and was
      apparently an incompleted curtain partitioning his cell from some space
      farther in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not with any vaulting hopes, for an egress from this inner space seemed
      less unlikely than from the one he occupied, he pulled himself on the top
      of the intervening wall and lowered himself over the other side. At the
      full stretch of his arms he failed to touch anything with his feet; an
      alarming thought came to him; he would have pulled himself back, but the
      top of the wall was crumbling to his fingers, a mass of rotten mortar
      threatening each moment to break below his grasp, and he realised with a
      spasm of the diaphragm that now there was no retreat. What&mdash;this was
      his thought&mdash;what if this was the mouth of a well? Or a mediaeval
      trap for fools? He had seen such things in French castles. In the pitch
      darkness he could not guess whether he hung above an abyss or had the
      ground within an inch of his straining toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To die in a pit!
    </p>
    <p>
      To die in a pit! good God!&mdash;was this the appropriate conclusion to a
      life with so much of open-air adventure, sunshine, gaiety, and charm in
      it? The sweat streamed upon his face as he strove vainly to hang by one of
      his arms and search the cope of the crumbling wall for a surer hold with
      the other; he stretched his toes till his muscles cramped, his eyes in the
      darkness filled with a red cloud, his breath choked him, a vision of his
      body thrashing through space overcame him, and his slipping fingers would
      be loose from the mortar in another minute!
    </p>
    <p>
      To one last struggle for a decent mastery his natural manhood rose, and
      cleared his brain and made him loose his grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell less than a yard!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stopped to laugh at his foolish terror, and then set
      busily to explore this new place in which he found himself. The air was
      fresher; the walls on either hand contracted into the space of a lobby; he
      felt his way along for twenty paces before he could be convinced that he
      was in a sort of tunnel. But figure a so-convenient tunnel in connection
      with a prison cell! It was too good to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      With no great surrender to hope even yet, he boldly plunged into the
      darkness, reason assuring him that the <i>cul-de-sac</i> would come sooner
      or later. But for once reason was wrong; the passage opened ever before
      him, more airy than ever, always dank and odorous, but with never a
      barrier&mdash;a passage the builders of the castle had executed for an age
      of sudden sieges and alarms, but now archaic and useless, and finally
      forgotten altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked, he knew not how long, when he was brought up by a curious
      sound&mdash;a prolonged, continuous, hollow roar as of wind in a wood or a
      sea that rolled on a distant beach. Vainly he sought to identify it, but
      finally shook aside his wonder and pushed on again till he came to the
      apparent end of the passage, where a wooden door barred his progress
      farther. He stopped as much in amazement as in dubiety about the door, for
      the noise that had baffled him farther back in the tunnel was now close at
      hand, and he might have been in a ship's hold and the ship all blown about
      by tempest, to judge from the inexplicable thunder that shook the
      darkness. A score of surmises came quickly, only to be dismissed as
      quickly as they came; that extraordinary tumult was beyond his
      understanding, and so he applied himself to his release. Still his lucky
      fortune remained with him; the door was merely on a latch. He plucked it
      open eagerly, keen to solve the puzzle of the noise, emerging on a night
      now glittering with stars, and clamant with the roar of tumbling waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple explanation!&mdash;he had come out beside the river. The passage
      came to its conclusion under the dumb arch of a bridge whose concaves
      echoed back in infinite exaggeration every sound of the river as it gulped
      in rocky pools below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape round about him in the starshine had a most bewitching
      influence. Steep banks rose from the riverside and lost themselves in a
      haze of frost, through which, more eminent, stood the boles and giant
      members of vast gaunt trees, their upper branches fretting the starry sky.
      No snow was on the spot where he emerged, for the wind, blowing huge
      wreaths against the buttresses of the bridge a little higher on the bank,
      had left some vacant spaces, but the rest of the world was blanched
      well-nigh to the complexion of linen. Where he was to turn to first
      puzzled Count Victor. He was free in a whimsical fashion, indeed, for he
      was scarcely more than half-clad, and he wore a pair of dancing-shoes,
      ludicrously inappropriate for walking in such weather through the country.
      He was free, but he could not be very far yet from his cell; the discovery
      of his escape might be made known at any moment; and even now while he
      lingered here he might have followers in the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of the uncovered grass he climbed the bank and sought the
      shelter of a thicket where the young trees grew too dense to permit the
      snow to enter. From here another hazard of flight was manifest, for he
      could see now that the face of the country outside on the level was spread
      as with a tablecloth, its white surface undisturbed, ready for the impress
      of so light an object as a hopping wren. To make his way across it would
      be to drag his bonds behind him, plainly asking the world to pull him
      back. Obviously there must be a more tactical retreat, and without more
      ado he followed the river's course, keeping ever, as he could, in the
      shelter of the younger woods, where the snow did not lie or was gathered
      by the wind in alleys and walls. Forgotten was the cold in his hurried
      flight through the trees; but by-and-by it compelled his attention, and he
      fell to beating his arms in the shelter of a plantation of yews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mort de ma vie!</i>&rdquo; he thought while in this occupation, &ldquo;why should
      I not have a roquelaire? If his very ungracious Grace refuses to see when
      a man is dying of cold for want of a coat, shall the man not help himself
      to a loan? M. le Duc owes Cammercy something for that ride in a glass
      coach, and for a night of a greatcoat I shall be pleased to discharge the
      family obligation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor there and then came to a bold decision. He would, perhaps,
      not only borrow a coat and cover his nakedness, but furthermore cover his
      flight by the same strategy. The only place in the neighbourhood where he
      could obscure his footsteps in that white night of stars was in the castle
      itself&mdash;perhaps in the very fosse whence he had made his escape.
      There the traffic of the day was bound to have left a myriad tracks,
      amongst which the imprint of a red-heeled Rouen shoe would never advertise
      itself. But it was too soon yet to risk so bold a venture, for his absence
      might be at this moment the cause of search round all the castle, and
      ordinary prudence suggested that he should permit some time to pass before
      venturing near the dwelling that now was in his view, its lights blurred
      by haze, no sign apparent that they missed or searched for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour or more, therefore, he kept his blood from congelation by
      walking back and forward in the thicket into which the softly breathing
      but shrewish night wind penetrated less cruelly than elsewhere, and at
      last judged the interval enough to warrant his advance upon the
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold then Count Victor running hard across the white level waste of the
      park into the very boar's den&mdash;a comic spectacle, had there been any
      one to see it, in a dancer's shoes and hose, coatless and excited. He
      looked over the railing of the fosse to find the old silence undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was his flight discovered yet? If not it was something of a madness, after
      all, to come back to the jaws of the trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a pretty problem!&rdquo; he told himself, hesitating upon the brink of
      the ditch into which dipped a massive stair&mdash;&ldquo;Here's a pretty
      problem! to have the roquelaire or to fly without it and perish of cold,
      because there is one chance in twenty that monsieur the warder opposite my
      chamber may not be wholly a fool and may have looked into his mousetrap. I
      do not think he has; at all events here are the alternatives, and the
      wiser is invariably the more unpleasant. <i>Allons!</i> Victor, <i>advienne
      que pourra</i>, and Heaven help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran quickly down the stair into the fosse, crept along in the shelter
      of the ivy for a little, saw that no one was visible, and darted across
      and up to a postern in the eastern turret. The door creaked noisily as he
      entered, and a flight of stairs, dimly lit by candles, presented itself,
      up which he ventured with his heart in his mouth. On the first landing
      were two doors, one of them ajar; for a second or two he hesitated with
      every nerve in his flesh pulsating and his heart tumultuous in his breast;
      then hearing nothing, took his courage in his hands and blandly entered,
      with his feet at a fencer's balance for the security of his retreat if
      that were necessary. There was a fire glowing in the apartment&mdash;a
      tempting spectacle for the shivering refugee, a dim light burned within a
      glass shade upon the mantel, and a table laden with drug-vials was drawn
      up to the side of a heavily-curtained bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor compassed the whole at a glance, and not the least pleasant
      part of the spectacle was the sight of a coat&mdash;not a greatcoat, but
      still a coat&mdash;upon the back of a chair that stood between the bed and
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a thousand apologies to his Grace,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, and
      tiptoed in his soaking shoes across the floor without reflecting for a
      second that the bed might have an occupant. He examined the coat; it had a
      familiar look that might have indicated its owner even if there had not
      been the flageolet lying beside it. Instinctively Count Victor turned
      about and went up to the bed, where, silently peeping between the
      curtains, he saw his enemy of the morning so much in a natural slumber as
      it seemed that he was heartened exceedingly. Only for a moment he looked;
      there was the certainty of some one returning soon to the room, and
      accordingly he rapidly thrust himself into the coat and stepped back upon
      the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one thing wanting&mdash;a sword! Why should he not have his
      own back again? As he remembered the interview of the morning, the chamber
      in which he had left his weapon at the bidding of the Duke was close at
      hand, and probably it was still there. Each successive hazard audaciously
      faced emboldened him the more; and so he ventured along, searching amid a
      multitude of doors in dim rushlight till he came upon one that was
      different from its neighbours only inasmuch as it had a French motto
      painted across the panels. The motto read &ldquo;<i>Revenez bientôt</i>,&rdquo; and
      smiling at the omen, Count Victor once more took his valour in his fingers
      and turned the handle. &ldquo;<i>Revenez bientôt</i>&rdquo; he was whispering softly
      to himself as he noiselessly pushed in the door. The sentence froze on his
      lips when he saw the Duchess seated in a chair, and turned half round to
      look at him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII &mdash; THE INDISCRETION OF THE DUCHESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was no drawing back; the circumstances positively forbade it, even
      if a certain smile following fast upon the momentary embarrassment of the
      Duchess had not prompted him to put himself at her mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; he said, standing in the
      doorway. &ldquo;<i>Je vous dérange</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her chair composedly, a figure of matured grace and
      practised courtliness, and above all with an air of what he flattered
      himself was friendliness. She directed him to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pleasure is unexpected, monsieur,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but it is a moment for
      quick decision, I suppose. What is the cue? To be desperate?&rdquo; here she
      laughed softly, &ldquo;or to take a chair? Monsieur has called to see his Grace.
      I regret exceedingly that a pressing business has called my husband to the
      town, and he is unlikely to be back for another hour at least. If monsieur&mdash;assuming
      desperation is not the cue&mdash;will please to be seated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor was puzzled for a second or two, but came farther into the
      room, and, seeing the lady resume her seat, he availed himself of her
      invitation and took the chair she offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; he went on to say with some evidence of confusion
      that prejudiced her the more in his favour, &ldquo;I am, as you see, in the
      drollest circumstances, and&mdash;pardon the <i>bêtise</i>&mdash;time is
      at the moment the most valuable of my assets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried with a low laugh that gave evidence of the sunniest
      disposition in the world&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! that is not a pretty speech, monsieur!
      But there! you cannot, of course, know my powers of entertainment.
      Positively there need be no hurry. On my honour, as the true friend of a
      gentleman who looked very like monsieur, and was, by the way, a
      compatriot, I repeat there is no occasion for haste. I presume monsieur
      found no servants&mdash;those stupid servants!&mdash;to let him into the
      house, and wisely found an entrance for himself? How droll! It is our way
      in these barbaric places; people just come and go as they please; we waive
      ceremony. By the way, monsieur has not done me the honour to confide to me
      his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Madame la Duchesse, I&mdash;I forget it myself at the
      moment,&rdquo; said Count Victor, divining her strategy, but too much
      embarrassed to play up to her lead. &ldquo;Perhaps madame may remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew down her brows in a comical frown, and then rippled into low
      laughter. &ldquo;Now, how in the world should I know if monsieur does not? I,
      that have never&rdquo;&mdash;here she stared in his face with a solemnity in
      which her amusement struggled&mdash;&ldquo;never, to my knowledge, seen him
      before. I have heard the Duke speak of a certain M. Soi-disant! perhaps
      monsieur is Monsieur Soi-disant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sans doute</i>, Madame la Duchesse, and madame's very humble servant,&rdquo;
       acquiesced Count Victor, relieved to have his first impression of strategy
      confirmed, and inclining his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him archly and laughed again. &ldquo;I have a great admiration for
      your sex, M. Soi-disant,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my dear Duke compels it, but now and
      then&mdash;now and then&mdash;I think it a little stupid. Not to know your
      own name! I hope monsieur does not hope to go through life depending upon
      women all the time to set him at ease in his chair. You are obviously not
      at ease in your chair, Monsieur Soi-disant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this coat, Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; Count Victor replied, looking down
      at the somewhat too ample sleeves and skirt; &ldquo;I fell into it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very obvious,&rdquo; she interrupted, with no effort to conceal her
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fell into it by sheer accident, and it fits me like an evil habit, and
      under the circumstances is as inconvenient to get rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still an excellent coat, monsieur. Let me see; has it not a familiar
      look? Oh! I remember; it is very like one I have seen with the Duke's
      Chamberlain&mdash;poor fellow! Monsieur has doubtless heard of his
      accident, and will be glad to learn that he is out of danger, and like to
      be abroad in a very short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a humour touching him too closely; he replied in a monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was the coat gave me the impression that I had seen monsieur
      somewhere before. He reminds me, as I have said, of a compatriot who was
      the cause of the Chamberlain's injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is now, doubtless, in prison,&rdquo; added the Count, bent on giving
      evidence of some inventiveness of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! by no means,&rdquo; cried the Duchess. &ldquo;He was in a cell, but escaped two
      or three hours ago, as our watchman discovered, and is now probably far
      away from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; said Count Victor with nonchalance, &ldquo;I daresay they will
      speedily recapture him. If they only knew the way with any of my
      compatriots it is to put a woman in his path, only she must be a woman of
      <i>esprit</i> and charm, and she shall engage him, I'll warrant, till the
      pursuit come up, even if it takes a century and the axe is at the end of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count hemmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both broke into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily, then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;he need have no anxiety on that score, should
      he meet the lady, for the pursuit is neither hot nor hearty. Between
      ourselves, monsieur, it is non-existent. If I were to meet this person we
      speak of I should&mdash;but for the terror I know I should feel in his
      society&mdash;tell him that so long as he did not venture within a couple
      of miles of this castle he was perfectly safe from interference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet a dangerous man, Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; said Count Victor; &ldquo;and I
      have heard the Duke is determined on his punishment, which is of course
      proper&mdash;from his Grace's point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! I am told he is a dangerous man, a very monster. The Duke
      assured me of that, though if I were to tell the truth, Monsieur
      Soi-disant, I saw no evidence of it in the young gentleman when I met him
      last night. A most harmless fellow, I assure you. Are monsieur's feet not
      cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was staring at his red-heeled dancing-shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pas du tout!</i>&rdquo; he replied promptly, tucking them under his chair.
      &ldquo;These experiments in costume are a foible with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a step along the corridor outside, which made him snap off his
      sentence hurriedly and turn listening and apprehensive. Again the Duchess
      was amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, it is not his Grace yet; you are all impatience to meet
      him, I see, and my poor company makes little amends for his absence; but
      it is as I say, he will not be back for another hour. You are interested,
      doubtless, in the oddities of human nature; for me I am continually
      laughing at the transparency of the stratagems whereby men like my husband
      try to lock their hearts up like a garden and throw away the key before
      they come into the company of their wives. I'm <i>sure</i> your poor feet
      must be cold. You did not drive? Such a night of snow too! I cannot
      approve of your foible for dancing-shoes to wade through snow in such
      weather. As I was saying, you are not only the stupid sex sometimes, but a
      most transparent one. I will let you into a little secret that may
      convince you that what I say of our Count What's-his-name not being hunted
      is true. I see quite clearly that the Duke is delighted to have this
      scandal of a duel&mdash;oh! the shocking things, duels, Monsieur
      Soi-disant!&mdash;shut up. In the forenoon he was mightily vexed with that
      poor Count What-do-you-call-him for a purely personal reason that I may
      tell you of later, but mainly because his duty compelled him to secure the
      other party to the&mdash;let us say, outrage. You follow, Monsieur
      Soi-disant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parfaitement</i>, Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; said Count Victor, wondering
      where all this led to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a foolish sentimentalist, I daresay you may think&mdash;for a person
      of my age (are you quite comfortable, monsieur? I fear that chair does not
      suit you)&mdash;I am a foolish sentimentalist, as I have said, and I may
      tell you I pleaded very hard for the release of this luckless compatriot
      of yours who was then in the fosse. But, oh dear! his Grace was adamant,
      as is the way with dukes, at least in this country, and I pleaded in
      vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, madame; his Grace had his duty as a good subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said the Duchess; &ldquo;but there have been occasions in history,
      they assure me, when good subjects have been none the less nice husbands.
      Monsieur can still follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor smiled and bowed again, and wished to heaven her Grace the
      Duchess had a little more of the gift of expedition. He had come looking
      for a sword and found a sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I weary you,&rdquo; she went on complacently. &ldquo;I was about to say that
      while the Duke desires to do his duty, even at the risk of breaking his
      wife's heart, it was obvious to me he was all the time sorry to have to do
      it, and when we heard that our Frenchman had escaped I, take my word for
      it, was not the only one relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder, madame,&rdquo; said Montaiglon, &ldquo;that the subject in this case
      should capitulate to&mdash;to&mdash;to the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the loving husband, you were about to say. La! you are too gallant,
      monsieur, I declare. And as a matter of fact the true explanation is less
      to my husband's credit and less flattering to me, for he had his own
      reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One generally has,&rdquo; reflected the Count aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite! and in his case they are very often mine. Dear Archie! Though he
      did not think I knew it, I saw clearly that he had his own reasons, as I
      say, to wish the Frenchman well out of the country. Now could you guess
      what these reasons were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor confessed with shame that it was beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you. They were not his own interests, and they were not mine,
      that influenced him; I had not to think very hard to discover that they
      were the interests of the Chamberlain. I fancy his Grace knows that the
      less inquiry there is into this encounter the better for all concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay, Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; agreed Count Victor, &ldquo;and yet the world
      speaks well of the Chamberlain, one hears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woe unto you when all men speak well of you!&rdquo; quoted the Duchess
      sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only happens when the turf is in our teeth,&rdquo; said the Count, &ldquo;and then
      <i>De mortuis</i> is a motto our dear friends use more as an excuse than
      as a moral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like our Chamberlain, monsieur; I may frankly tell you so. I
      should not be surprised to learn that my husband knows a little more about
      him than I do, and I give you my word I know enough to consider him
      hateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are most delicate considerations, Madame la Duchesse,&rdquo; said the
      Count, vastly charmed by her manner but naturally desirous of the open
      air. Every step he heard in neighbouring lobbies, every slammed door,
      spoiled his attention to the lady's confidences, and he had an uneasy
      sense that she was not wholly unamused at his predicament, however much
      his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delicate considerations, true, but I fear they do not interest Monsieur
      Soi-disant. How should they indeed? Gossip, monsieur, gossip! At our age,
      as you might say, we must be chattering. I <i>know</i> you are
      uncomfortable on that chair. Do, monsieur, please take another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he was convinced of his first suspicion that she was having her
      revenge for his tactless remark to her husband, for he had not stirred at
      all in his chair, but had only reddened, and she had a smile at the
      corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my age, Madame la Duchesse, we are quite often impertinent fools.
      There is, however, but one age&mdash;the truly golden. We reach it when we
      fall first in love, and there love keeps us. His Grace, Madame la
      Duchesse, is, I am sure, the happiest of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was seated opposite him. Leaning forward a little, she put forth her
      hand in a motherly, unembarrassed way, and placed it for a moment on his
      knee, looking into his face, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy! good boy!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she rose as if to hint that it was time for him to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are impatient; perhaps you may meet the Duke on his way back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmed, Madame la Duchesse, I assure you,&rdquo; said the Count with a
      grimace, and they both fell into laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself first to scan the shoes and coat again. &ldquo;How droll!&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;Ah, monsieur, you are delightful in your foibles, but I wish it
      had looked like any other coat than Simon Mac-Taggart's. I have never seen
      his without wondering how many dark secrets were underneath the velvet.
      Had this coat of yours been a perfect fit, believe me I had not expected
      much from you of honour or of decency. Oh! there I go on chattering again,
      and you have said scarcely twenty words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Madame la Duchesse, it is because I can find none good enough
      to express my gratitude,&rdquo; said Count Victor, making for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Monsieur Soi-disant, a fig for your gratitude! Would you have me
      inhospitable to a guest who would save me even the trouble of opening my
      door? And that, by the way, reminds me, monsieur, that you have not even
      hinted at what you might be seeking his Grace for? Could it be&mdash;could
      it be for a better fit in coats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a mere trifle, madame, no more than my sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sword, monsieur? I know nothing of Monsieur Soi-disant's sword, but
      I think I know where is one might serve his purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she went out of the room, hurried along the corridor, and
      returned in a moment or two with Count Victor's weapon, which she dragged
      back by its belt as if she loathed an actual contact with the thing
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, affecting a shudder. &ldquo;A mouse and a rapier, they are my
      bitterest horrors. If you could only guess what a coward I am! Good night,
      monsieur, and I hope&mdash;I hope&rdquo;&mdash;she laughed as she hung on the
      wish a moment&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you will meet his Grace on the way. If so, you
      may tell him 'tis rather inclement weather for the night air&mdash;at his
      age,&rdquo; and she laughed again. &ldquo;If you do not see him&mdash;as is possible&mdash;come
      back soon; look! my door bids you in your own language&mdash;<i>Revenez
      bientôt</i>. I am sure he will be charmed to see you, and to make his
      delight the more I shall never mention you were here tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went along the lobby and looked down the stair to see that the way was
      clear; came back and offered her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Duchesse, you are very magnanimous,&rdquo; he said, exceedingly
      grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imprudent, rather,&rdquo; she corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnanimity and Prudence are cousins who, praise <i>le bon Dieu!</i>
      never speak to each other, and the world is very much better for it.&rdquo; He
      pointed to the motto on the panel. &ldquo;I may never come back, madame,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;but at least I shall never forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au plaisir de vous revoir</i>, Monsieur Soi-disant,&rdquo; she said in
      conclusion, and went into her room and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there's a darling!&rdquo; said the Duchess as she heard his footsteps
      softly departing. &ldquo;Archie was just such another&mdash;at his age.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII &mdash; BACK IN DOOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night brooded on the Highlands when Count Victor reached the shore.
      Snow and darkness clotted in the clefts of the valleys opening innumerably
      on the sea, but the hills held up their heads and thought among the stars&mdash;unbending
      and august and pure, knowing nothing at all of the glens and shadows. It
      was like a convocation of spirits. The peaks rose everywhere white to the
      brows and vastly ruminating. An ebbing tide too, so that the strand was
      bare. Upon the sands where there had been that folly of the morning the
      waves rolled in an ascending lisp, spilled upon at times with gold when
      the decaying moon&mdash;a halbert-head thrown angrily among Ossian's
      flying ghosts, the warrior clouds&mdash;cut through them sometimes and was
      so reflected in the sea. The sea was good; good to hear and smell; the
      flying clouds were grateful to the eye; the stars&mdash;he praised God for
      the delicious stars not in words but in an exultation of gratitude and
      affection, yet the mountain-peaks were most of all his comforters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had run from the castle as if the devil had been at his red heels, with
      that ridiculous coat flapping its heavily braided skirts about his calves;
      passed through snow-smothered gardens, bordered boding dark plantations of
      firs, leaped opposing fell-dykes whence sheltering animals ran terrified
      at the apparition, and he came out upon the seaside at the bay as one who
      has overcome a nightmare and wakens to see the familiar friendly glimmer
      of the bedroom fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A miracle! and mainly worked by a glimpse of these blanched hills. For he
      knew now they were an inseparable part of his memory of Olivia, <i>her</i>
      hills, <i>her</i> sheltering sentinels, the mere sight of them Doom's
      orison. Though he had thought of her so much when he shivered in the
      fosse, it had too often been as something unattainable, never to be seen
      again perhaps, a part of his life past and done with. An incubus rode his
      chest, though he never knew till now, when it fled at the sight of
      Olivia's constant friends the mountains. Why, the girl lived! her home was
      round the corner there dark-jutting in the sea! He could, with some
      activity, be rapping at her father's door in a couple of hours!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Grace de Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us leave trifles and go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious sign of his preoccupation, ever since he had escaped from
      his imprisonment, that he should not once have thought on where he was to
      fly to till this moment when the hills inspired. &ldquo;Silence, thought, calm,
      and purity, here they are!&rdquo; they seemed to tell him, and by no means
      unattainable. Where (now that he had time to think of it) could he
      possibly go to-night but to the shelter of Doom? Let the morrow decide for
      itself. <i>À demain les affaires sérieuses!</i> Doom and&mdash;Olivia.
      What eyes she had, that girl! They might look upon the assailant of her
      wretched lover with anything but favour; yet even in anger they were more
      to him than those of all the world else in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure Count Victor was not standing all the time of these reflections
      shivering in the snow. He had not indulged a moment's hesitation since
      ever he had come out upon the bay, and he walked through the night as fast
      as his miserable shoes would let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miles passed, he crossed the rivers that mourned through hollow arches
      and spread out in brackish pools along the shore. Curlews piped dolorously
      the very psalm of solitude, and when he passed among the hazel-woods of
      Strone and Achnatra, their dark recesses belled continually with owls. It
      was the very pick of a lover's road: no outward vision but the sombre
      masses of the night, the valleys of snow, and the serene majestic hills to
      accompany that inner sight of the woman; no sounds but that of solemn
      waters and the forest creatures to make the memory of her words the
      sweeter. A road for lovers, and he was the second of the week, though he
      did not know it. Only, Simon MacTaggart had come up hot-foot on his horse,
      a trampling conqueror (as he fancied), the Count trudged shamefully
      undignified through snow that came high upon the silken stockings, and
      long ago had made his dancing-shoes shapeless and sodden. But he did not
      mind that; he had a goal to make for, an ideal to cherish timidly; once or
      twice he found himself with some surprise humming Gringoire's song, that
      surely should never go but with a light heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the fulness of time he approached the point of land from which he
      knew he could first see Doom's dark promontory if it were day. There his
      steps slowed. Somehow it seemed as if all his future fortune depended upon
      whether or not a light shone through the dark to greet him. Between him
      and the sea rolling in upon a spit of the land there was&mdash;of all
      things!&mdash;a herd of deer dimly to be witnessed running back and
      forward on the sand as in some confusion at his approach; at another time
      the thing should have struck him with amazement, but now he was too busy
      with his speculation whether Doom should gleam on him or not to study this
      phenomenon of the frosty winds. He made a bargain with himself: if the
      isle was black, that must mean his future fortune; if a light was there,
      however tiny, it was the star of happy omen, it was&mdash;it was&mdash;it
      was several things he dared not let himself think upon for fear of
      immediate disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute he paused as if to gather his courage and then make a dash
      round the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ventre Dieu!</i> Blackness! His heart ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as most men do in similar circumstances, he decided that the
      test was a preposterous one. Why, faith! should he relinquish hope of
      everything because&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What! the light was there. Like a fool he had misjudged the distance in
      the darkness and had been searching for it in the wrong place. It was so
      bright that it might be a star estrayed, a tiny star and venturesome, gone
      from the keeping of the maternal moon and wandered into the wood behind
      Doom to tangle in the hazel-boughs. A dear star! a very gem of stars! a
      star more precious than all the others in that clustered sky, because it
      was the light of Olivia's window. A plague on all the others with their
      twinkling search among the clouds for the little one lost! he wished it
      had been a darker night that he might have only this one visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      By rights he should be weary and cold, and the day's events should trouble
      him; but to tell the truth, he was in a happy exaltation all the rest of
      the way. Sometimes the star of hope evaded him as he followed the bending
      path, trees interposing; he only ran the faster to get it into his vision
      again, and it was his beacon up to the very walls of Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle took possession of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      How odd that he should have fancied that brave tower arrogant; it was
      tranced in the very air of friendliness and love&mdash;the fairy
      residence, the moated keep of all the sweet old tales his nurse was used
      to tell him when he was a child in Cam-mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there he had a grateful memory of the ringleted middle-aged lady who
      had alternately whipped and kissed him, and in his night's terrors soothed
      him with tales. &ldquo;My faith!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou didst not think thy Perrault's
      'Contes des Fées' might, twenty years after, have so close an application
      to a woman and a tower in misty Albion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked deliberately across to the rock, went round the tower, stood a
      moment in the draggled arbour&mdash;the poor arbour of dead ideals. Doom,
      that once was child of the noisy wars, was dead as the Château d'Arques
      save for the light in its mistress's window. Poor old shell! and yet
      somehow he would not have had it otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced and rapped at the door. The sound rang in the interior, and
      presently Mungo's shuffling steps were heard and his voice behind the door
      inquiring who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; answered Count Victor, humouring the little old man's fancy
      for affairs of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend!&rdquo; repeated Mungo with contempt. &ldquo;A man on a horse has aye
      hunders o' frien's in the gutter, as Annapla says, and it wad need to be
      somethin' rarer to get into Doom i' the mirk o' nicht. I opened the door
      to a frien' the ither nicht and he gripped me by the craig and fair choked
      me afore I could cry a barley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i> Do not flatter my English so much as to tell me you do not
      recognise Count Victor's accent through a door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord keep 's!&rdquo; cried Mungo, hastily drawing his bolts. &ldquo;Hae ye changed
      ye'r mind already and left the inns? It's a guid thing for your wife ye're
      no marrit, or she wad be the sorry woman wi' sic a shiftin' man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His astonishment was even greater when Count Victor stood before him a
      ludicrous figure with his too ample coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinna tell me ye hae come through the snaw this nicht like that!&rdquo; he
      cried incredulous, holding up his candle the better to examine the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor laughed, and for an answer simply thrust forth a sopping foot
      to his examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, ye must hae been hot on't!&rdquo; said the servant, shaking his cowled
      head till the tassel danced above his temple. &ldquo;Ye'r shoon's fair steeped
      wi' water. Water's an awfu' thing to rot ye'r boots; I aye said if it
      rotted ane's boots that way, whit wad it no' dae to ane's stamach? Oh,
      sirs! sirs! this is becomin' the throng hoose, wi' comin's and goin's and
      raps and roars and collie-shangies o' a' kin's. If it wasna me was the
      canny gaird o't it's Himsel' wad hae to flit for the sake o' his nicht's
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You behold, Mungo, the daw in borrowed plumes,&rdquo; said Count Victor as the
      door was being barred again. &ldquo;I hope the daw felt more comfortable than I
      do in mine,&rdquo; and he ruefully surveyed his apparel. &ldquo;Does Master Mungo
      recognise these peacock feathers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo scanned the garment curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's gey like ane I've seen on a bigger man,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a better, perhaps, thought my worthy Mungo. I remember me that our
      peacock was a diplomatist and had huge interest in your delightful
      stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A movement of Mungo's made him turn to see the Baron standing behind him a
      little bewildered at this apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Failte!</i>&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;and I fancy you would be none the waur,
      as we say, of the fireside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went before him into the <i>salle</i>, taking Mungo's candle. Mungo was
      despatched for Annapla, and speedily the silent abigail of visions was
      engaged upon that truly Gaelic courtesy, the bathing of the traveller's
      feet. The Baron considerately made no inquiries; if it was a caprice of
      Count Victor's to venture in dancing shoes and a borrowed jacket through
      dark snow-swept roads, it was his own affair. And the Count was so much
      interested in the new cheerfulness of his host (once so saturnine and
      melancholy) that he left his own affairs unmentioned for a while as the
      woman worked. It was quite a light-hearted recluse this, compared with
      that he had left a week ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised you found yon place dull,&rdquo; at the last hazarded the
      Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Comment?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down-by, I mean. I'm glad myself always to get home out of it at this
      season. When the fishers are there it's all my fancy, but when it does not
      smell of herring, the stench of lawyers' sheepskins gets on the top and is
      mighty offensive to any man that has had muckle to do with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dull!&rdquo; repeated Count Victor, now comprehending; &ldquo;I have crowded more
      experience into the past four-and-twenty hours than I might meet in a
      month anywhere east of Calais. I have danced with a duchess, fought a
      stupid duel, with a town looking on for all the world as if it were a
      performance in a circus with lathen weapons, moped in a dungeon, broken
      through the same, stolen a coat, tramped through miles of snow in a pair
      of pantoufles, forgotten to pay the bill at the inn, and lost my baggage
      and my reputation&mdash;which latter I swear no one in these parts will be
      glad to pick up for his own use. Baron, I'll be shot if your country is
      not bewitched. My faith! what happenings since I came here expecting to be
      killed with <i>ennui!</i> I protest I shall buy a Scots estate and ask all
      my friends over here to see real life. Only they must have good
      constitutions; I shall insist on them having good constitutions. And
      there's another thing&mdash;it necessitates that they must have so kind a
      friend as Monsieur le Baron and so hospitable a house as Doom to fall back
      on when their sport comes to a laughable termination, as mine has done
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then you have found your needle in the haystack after all?&rdquo; cried
      Doom, vastly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found the devil!&rdquo; cried Montaiglon, a shade of vexation in his
      countenance, for he had not once that day had a thought of all that had
      brought, him into Scotland. &ldquo;The haystack must be stuck full of needles
      like the bran of a pin-cushion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this one, who is not the particular needle named Drimdarroch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give you three guesses, M. le Baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom reflected, pulled out his nether lip with his fingers, looking hard
      at his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the Chamberlain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i>&rdquo; thought the Count, &ldquo;can the stern unbending parent have
      relented? You are quite right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no other. But it is not a matter
      of the most serious importance. I lost my coat and the gentleman lost a
      little blood. I have the best assurances that he will be on foot again in
      a week or two, by which time I hope&mdash;at all events I expect&mdash;to
      be out of all danger of being invited to resume the entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime here's Doom, yours&mdash;so long as it is mine&mdash;while
      it's your pleasure to bide in it if you fancy yourself safe from
      molestation,&rdquo; said the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that I think I may be tranquil. I have, there too, the best
      assurances that the business will be hushed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, though in any case this seems to have marred your
      real engagements here in the matter of Drimdarroch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor's turn it was to feel vexation now. He pulled his moustache
      and reddened. &ldquo;As to that, Baron,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I pray you not to despise me,
      for I have to confess that my warmth in the mission that brought me here
      has abated sadly. You need not ask me why. I cannot tell you. As for me
      and my affair, I have not forgotten, nor am I likely wholly to forget; but
      your haystack is as <i>difficile</i> as you promised it should be, and&mdash;there
      are divers other considerations. It necessitates that I go home. There
      shall be some raillery at my expense doubtless&mdash;<i>Ciel!</i> how
      Louis my cousin will laugh!&mdash;but no matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a little abstractedly, for he saw a delicate situation
      approaching. He was sure to be asked&mdash;once Annapla's service was over&mdash;what
      led to the encounter, and to give the whole story frankly involved
      Olivia's name unpleasantly in a vulgar squabble. He saw for the first time
      that he had been wholly unwarranted in taking the defence of the Baron's
      interests into his own hands. Could he boldly intimate that in his opinion
      jealousy of himself had been the spring of the Chamberlain's midnight
      attacks on the castle of Doom? That were preposterous! And yet that seemed
      the only grounds that would justify his challenging the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Annapla was gone then Doom got the baldest of histories. He was
      encouraged to believe that all this busy day of adventure had been due to
      a simple quarrel after a game of cards, and where he should have preferred
      a little more detail he had to content himself with a humorous narrative
      of the escape, the borrowing of the coat, and the interview with the
      Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now with your permission, Baron, I shall go to bed,&rdquo; at last said
      Count Victor. &ldquo;I shall sleep to-night, like a <i>sabot</i>. I am, I know,
      the boldest of beggars for your grace and kindness. It seems I am fated in
      this country to make free, not only with my enemy's coat, but with my dear
      friend's domicile as if it were an inn. To-morrow, Baron, I shall make my
      dispositions. The coat can be returned to its owner none the worse for my
      use of it, but I shall not so easily be able to square accounts with you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV &mdash; IN DAYS OF STORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a rigorous privacy of storm that lasted many days after his return, and
      cut Doom wholly off from the world at large, Count Victor spent what but
      for several considerations would have been&mdash;perhaps indeed they
      really were&mdash;among the happiest moments of his life. It was good in
      that tumultuous weather, when tempests snarled and frosts fettered the
      countryside, and the sea continually wrangled round the rock of Doom, to
      look out on the inclemency from windows where Olivia looked out too. She
      used to come and stand beside him, timidly perhaps at first, but by-and-by
      with no self-consciousness. Her sleeve would touch his, sometimes, indeed,
      her shoulder must press against his arm and little strands of her hair
      almost blow against his lips as in the narrow apertures of the tower they
      watched the wheeling birds from the outer ocean. For these birds she had
      what was little less than a passion. To her they represented the unlimited
      world of liberty and endeavour; at sight of them something stirred in her
      that was the gift of all the wandering years of that old Ulysses, her
      grandfather, to whom the beckoning lights of ships at sea were
      irresistible, and though she doted on the glens of her nativity, she had
      the spirit that invests every hint of distant places and far-off
      happenings with magic parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed content, and yet not wholly happy: he could hear her sometimes
      sigh, as he thought, from a mere wistfulness that had the illimitable
      spaces of the sea, the peopled isles and all their mystery for background.
      To many of the birds that beat and cried about the place she gave names,
      investing them with histories, recounting humorously their careers. And it
      was odd that however far she sent them in her fancy&mdash;to the distant
      Ind, to the vexed Pole itself&mdash;with joy in their travelling, she
      assumed that their greatest joy was when they found themselves at Doom.
      The world was a place to fare forth in as far as you could, only to give
      you the better zest for Doom on your return.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pleased her father hugely, but it scarcely tallied with the views of
      one who had fond memories of a land where sang the nightingale in its
      season, and roads were traversable in the wildest winter weather; still
      Count Victor was in no mood to question it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, save in rare moments of unpleasant reflection, supremely happy,
      thrilling to that accidental contact, paling at the narrow margins whereby
      her hair escaped conferring on him a delirium. He could stand at a window
      all day pretending interest in the monotonous hills and empty sea, only
      that he might keep her there too and indulge himself upon her eyes. They&mdash;so
      eager, deep, or busied with the matters of her thoughts&mdash;were enough
      for a common happiness; a debauch of it was in the contact of her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet something in this complacence of hers bewildered him. Here, if you
      please, was a woman who but the other night (as it were) was holding
      clandestine meetings with Simon MacTaggart, and loving him to that extent
      that she defied her father. She could not but know that this foreigner had
      done his worst to injure her in the inner place of her affections, and yet
      she was to him more friendly than she had been before. Several times he
      was on the point of speaking on the subject. Once, indeed, he made a
      playful allusion to the flautist of the bower that was provocative of no
      more than a reddened cheek and an interlude of silence. But tacitly the
      lover was a theme for strict avoidance. Not even the Baron had a word to
      say on that, and they were numberless the topics they discussed in this
      enforced sweet domesticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious household! How it found provisions in these days Mungo alone
      could tell. The little man had his fishing-lines out continually, his gun
      was to be heard in neighbouring thickets that seemed from the island
      inaccessible, and when gun and line failed him it was perhaps not wholly
      wanting his persuasion that kain fowls came from the hamlet expressly for
      &ldquo;her ladyship&rdquo; Olivia. In pauses of the wind he and Annapla were to be
      heard in other quarters of the house in clamant conversation&mdash;otherwise
      it had seemed to Count Victor that Doom was left, an enchanted castle, to
      him and Olivia alone. For the father relapsed anew into his old strange
      melancholies, dozing over his books, indulging feint and riposte in the
      chapel overhead, or gazing moodily along the imprisoned coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he was free to dress now as he chose in his beloved tartan
      entertained him only briefly; obviously half the joy of his former
      recreations in the chapel had been due to the fact that they were
      clandestine; now that he could wear what he chose indoors, he pined that
      he could not go into the deer-haunted woods and the snowy highways in the
      <i>breacan</i> as of old. But that was not his only distress, Count Victor
      was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What accounts for your father's melancholy?&rdquo; he had the boldness one day
      to ask Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at the window together, amused at the figure Mungo presented as
      with an odd travesty of the soldier's strategy, and all unseen as he
      fancied, he chased a fowl round the narrow confines of the garden, bent
      upon its slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you not know the reason for that?&rdquo; she asked, with her humour
      promptly clouded, and a loving and pathetic glance over her shoulder at
      the figure bent beside the fire. &ldquo;What is the dearest thing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could have put no more embarrassing question to Count Victor, and it
      was no wonder he stammered in his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dearest,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ah! well&mdash;well&mdash;the dearest,
      Mademoiselle Olivia; <i>ma foi!</i> there are so many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said impatiently, &ldquo;but only one or two are at the heart's
      core.&rdquo; She saw him smile at this, and reddened. &ldquo;Oh, how stupid I am to
      ask that of a stranger! I did not mean a lady&mdash;if there is a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There <i>is</i> a lady,&rdquo; said Count Victor, twisting the fringe of her
      shawl that had come of itself into his fingers as she turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed; not even he, so versed in all the evidence of love or
      coquetry, could have seen a quiver to betray her even if he had thought to
      look for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the one,&rdquo; said she at length, &ldquo;who will wish you well in that; but
      after her&mdash;after this&mdash;this lady&mdash;what is it that comes
      closest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What but my country!&rdquo; cried he, with a surging sudden memory of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; she acquiesced, &ldquo;your country! I am not wondering at that.
      And ours is the closest to the core of cores in us that have not perhaps
      so kind a country as yours, but still must love it when it is most cruel.
      We are like the folks I have read of&mdash;they were the Greeks who
      travelled so far among other clans upon the trade of war, and bound to
      burst in tears when they came after strange hills and glens to the sight
      of the same sea that washed the country of their infancy. 'Tha-latta!'&mdash;was
      it not that they cried? When I read the story first in school in
      Edinburgh, I cried, myself, 'Lochfinne!' and thought I heard the tide
      rumbling upon this same rock. It is for that; it is because we must be
      leaving here my father is sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was news
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving!&rdquo; said Count Victor in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so. My father has been robbed; his people have been foolish; it is
      not a new thing in the Highlands of Scotland, Count Victor. You must not
      be thinking him a churl to be moping and leaving you to my poor
      entertainment, for it is ill to keep the pipes in tune when one is drying
      tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; asked Count Victor, disturbed at the tidings and the
      distress she so bravely struggled to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? indeed!&rdquo; said Olivia. &ldquo;That I cannot tell you yet. But the world
      is wide, and it is strange if there is any spot of it where we cannot find
      some of our own Gaelic people who have been flitting for a generation,
      taking the world for their pillow. What is it that shall not come to an
      end? My sorrow! the story on our door down there has been preparing me for
      this since ever I was a bairn. My great-great-grandfather was the wise man
      and the far-seeing when he carved it there&mdash;'Man, Behauld the End of
      All, Be nocht Wiser than the Hiest. Hope in God!'&rdquo; She struggled
      courageously with her tears that could not wholly be restrained, and there
      and then he could have gathered her into his arms. But he must keep
      himself in bounds and twist the fringes of her shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Olivia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will die for the sight of home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she dashed her hand across her eyes and boldly faced him, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a shameful thing in a Baron's daughter,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No,
      indeed! when we must rise and go away, here is the woman who will go
      bravely! We live not in glens, in this house nor in that, but in the
      hearts that love us, and where my father is and friends are to be made, I
      think I can be happy yet. Look at the waves there, and the snow and the
      sea-birds! All these are in other places as well as here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not the same, but not the same! Here I swear I could live content
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said she, smiling, and the rogue a moment dancing in her eyes.
      &ldquo;No, no, Count Victor, to this you must be born like the stag in the
      corrie and the seal on the rock. We are a simple people, and a poor people&mdash;worse
      fortune!&mdash;poor and proud. Your world is different from ours, and
      there you will have friends that think of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said he, all aglow in passion but with a face of flint, &ldquo;you
      are leaving those behind that love you too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he watched her narrowly; she gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the poor people in the clachan there,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;some of them
      will not forget me I am hoping, but that is all. We go. It is good for us,
      perhaps. Something has been long troubling my father more than the
      degradation of the clans and all these law pleas that Petullo has now
      brought to the bitter end. He is proud, and he is what is common in the
      Highlands when the heart is sore&mdash;he is silent. You must not think it
      is for myself I am vexing to leave Doom Castle; it is for him. Look! do
      you see the dark spot on the side of the hill yonder up at Ardno? That is
      the yew-tree in the churchyard where my mother, his wife, lies; it is no
      wonder that at night sometimes he goes out to look at the hills, for the
      hills are over her there and over the generations of his people in the
      same place. I never knew my mother, <i>mothruaigh!</i> but he remembers,
      and it is the hundred dolours (as we say) for him to part. For me I have
      something of the grandfather in me, and would take the seven bens for it,
      and the seven glens, and the seven mountain moors, if it was only for the
      sake of the adventure, though I should always like to think that I would
      come again to these places of hered-ity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And through all this never a hint of Simon Mac-Taggart! Could there be any
      other conclusion than the joyous one&mdash;it made his heart bound!&mdash;that
      that affair was at an end? And yet how should he ascertain the truth about
      a matter so close upon his heart? He put his pride in his pocket and went
      down that afternoon with the Chamberlain's coat in his hands. There was a
      lull in the wind, and the servitor was out of doors caulking the little
      boat, the argosy of poor fortunes, which had been drawn up from the
      menacing tides so that its prow obtruded on the half-hearted privacy of
      the lady's bower. Deer were on the shore, one sail was on the blue of the
      sea, a long way off, a triumphant flash of sun lit up the innumerable
      glens. A pleasant interlude of weather, and yet Mungo was in what he
      called, himself, a tirravee. He was honestly becoming impatient with this
      undeparting foreigner, mainly because Annapla was day by day the more
      insistent that he had not come wading into Doom without boots entirely in
      vain, and that her prediction was to be fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See! Mungo,&rdquo; said the Count, &ldquo;the daw, if my memory fails me not, had his
      plumes pecked off him, but I seem fated to retain my borrowed feathers
      until I pluck myself. Is it that you can have them at the first
      opportunity restored to our connoisseur in <i>contes</i>&mdash;your friend
      the Chamberlain? It comes to occur to me that the gentleman's wardrobe may
      be as scanty as my own, and the absence of his coat may be the reason,
      more than my unfortunate pricking with a bodkin, for his inexplicable
      absence from&mdash;from&mdash;the lady's side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo had heard of the duel, of course; it was the understanding in Doom
      that all news was common property inasmuch as it was sometimes almost the
      only thing to pass round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It wasna' sae ill to jag a man that had a wound
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expiscate, good Master Mungo,&rdquo; said Count Victor, wondering. &ldquo;What wound
      already? You speak of the gentleman's susceptible heart perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak o' naethin' o' the kind, but o' the man's airm. Ye ken fine ye
      gied him a push wi' your whinger that first night he cam' here wi' his
      fenci-ble gang frae the Maltland and play-acted Black Andy o' Arroquhar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried Count Victor. &ldquo;I wounded somebody, certainly, but till
      now I had no notion it might be the gentleman himself. Well, let me do him
      the justice to say he made rather pretty play with his weapon on the
      sands, considering he was wounded. And so, honest Mungo, the garrison was
      not really taken by surprise that night you found yourself plucked out
      like a periwinkle from your wicket? As frankness is in fashion, I may say
      that for a while I gave you credit for treason to the house, and treason
      now it seems to have been, though not so black as I thought. It was
      MacTaggart who asked you to open the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha else? A bonny like cantrip! Nae doot it was because I tauld him
      Annapla's prophecy aboot a man with the bare feet. The deil's buckie! Ye
      kent yersel' brawly wha it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Master Mungo! Faith, not I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo looked incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what ails the ladyship, for she kent? I'll swear she kent the next
      day, though I took guid care no' to say cheep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you are mistaken there, my good Mungo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistaken! No me! It wasna a' thegither in a tantrum o' an ordinar' kind
      she broke her tryst wi' him the very nicht efter ye left for the inns doon
      by. At onyrate, if she didna' ken then she kens noo, I'll warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so far as I am concerned, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo looked incredulous. That any one should let go the chance of
      conveying so rare a piece of gossip to persons so immediately concerned
      was impossible of belief. &ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; said he, shaking his head; &ldquo;she has
      every word o't, or her faither at least, and that's the same thing. But
      shoon or nae shoon, yon's the man for my money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again he has my felicitations,&rdquo; said Count Victor, with a good humour
      unfailing. Indeed he could afford to be good-humoured if this were true.
      So here was the explanation of Olivia's condescension, her indifference to
      her lover's injury, of which her father could not fail to have apprised
      her even if Mungo had been capable of a miracle and held his tongue. The
      Chamberlain, then, was no longer in favour! Here was joy! Count Victor
      could scarce contain himself. How many women would have been flattered at
      the fierceness of devotion implied in a lover's readiness to commit
      assassination out of sheer jealousy of a supposititious rival in her
      affections? But Olivia&mdash;praise <i>le bon Dieu!</i>&mdash;was not like
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust the coat into Mungo's hands and went hurriedly up to his room to
      be alone with his thoughts, that he feared might show themselves plainly
      in his face if he met either the lady or her father, and there for the
      first time had a memory of Cecile&mdash;some odd irrelevance of a memory&mdash;in
      which she figured in a masque in a Paris garden. Good God! that he should
      have failed to see it before; this Cecile had been an actress, as, he told
      himself, were most of her sex he had hitherto encountered, and 'twas
      doubtful if he once had touched her soul. Olivia had shown him now, in
      silences, in sighs, in some unusual <i>aura</i> of sincerity that was
      round her like the innocence of infancy, that what he thought was love a
      year ago was but its drossy elements. Seeking the first woman in the eyes
      of the second, he had found the perfect lover there!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV &mdash; A DAMNATORY DOCUMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mungo took the coat into the castle kitchen, the true arcanum of Doom,
      where he and Annapla solved the domestic problems that in later years had
      not been permitted to disturb the mind of the master or his daughter. An
      enormous fireplace, arched like a bridge, and poorly enough fed nowadays
      compared with its gluttony in those happier years of his continual
      bemoaning, when plenty kept the spit perpetually at work, if it were only
      for the good of the beggars who blackened the road from the Lowlands, had
      a handful of peat in its centre to make the yawning orifice the more
      pathetic to eyes that had seen the flames leap there. Everywhere the
      evidence of the old abundant days&mdash;the rusting spit itself, the idle
      battery of cuisine, long rows of shining covers. Annapla, who was assumed
      to be true tutelary genius of these things, but in fact was beholden to
      the martial mannikin of Fife for inspiration and aid with the simplest of
      ragouts, though he would have died sooner than be suspected of the
      unsoldierly art of cookery,&mdash;Annapla was in one of her trances. Her
      head was swathed mountainously in shawls; her wild, black, lambent eyes
      had the look of distant contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord keep 's!&rdquo; said Mungo, entering, &ldquo;what are ye doverin' on noo? Wauken
      up, ye auld bitch, and gie this coat a dight. D'ye ken wha's ocht it? It
      belangs to a gentleman that's no' like noo to get but this same, and the
      back-o'-my-haun'-to-ye oot o' Doom Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the coat and brushed it in a lethargy, with odd, unintelligible
      chanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nane o' your warlock canticles!&rdquo; cried Mungo. &ldquo;Ye gied the lassie to the
      man that cam' withouten boots&mdash;sorrow be on the bargain! And if it's
      cast-in' a spell on the coat ye are, I'll raither clean't mysel'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he seized the garment from her and lustily applied himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bonny-like hostler-wife ye'll mak',&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And few'll come to Mungo
      Byde's hostelry if his wife's to be eternally in a deevilish dwaam,
      concocting Hielan' spells when she should be stirring at the broth. No'
      that I can blame ye muckle for a want o' the up-tak in what pertains to
      culinairy airts; for what hae ye seen here since ye cam' awa frae the rest
      o' the drove in Arroquhar but lang kail, and oaten brose, and mashlum
      bannocks? Oh! sirs, sirs!&mdash;I've seen the day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annapla emerged from her trance, and ogled him with an amusing admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And noo it's a' by wi't; it's the end o' the auld ballant,&rdquo; went on the
      little man. &ldquo;I've kept auld Doom in times o' rowth and splendour, and noo
      I'm spared to see't rouped, the laird a dyvour and a nameless wanderer
      ower the face o' the earth. He's gaun abroad, he tells me, and settles to
      sit doon aboot Dunkerque in France. It's but fair, maybe, that whaur his
      forbears squandered he should gang wi' the little that's to the fore. I
      mind o' his faither gaun awa at the last hoved up, a fair Jeshurun, his
      een like to loup oot o' his heid wi' fat, and comin' back a pooked craw
      frae the dicing and the drink, nae doot amoung the scatter-brained white
      cockades. Whatna shilpit man's this that Leevie's gotten for her new jo?
      As if I dinna see through them! The tawpie's taen the gee at the Factor
      because he played yon ploy wi' his lads frae the Maltland barracks, and
      this Frenchy's ower the lugs in love wi' her, I can see as plain as Cowal,
      though it's a shameless thing to say't. He's gotten gey far ben in a
      michty short time. Ye're aye saying them that come unsent for should sit
      unserved; but wha sent for this billy oot o' France? and wha has been sae
      coothered up as he has since he cam' here? The Baron doesnae ken the
      shifts that you and me's been put to for to save his repitation. Mony a
      lee I tauld doon there i' the clachan to soother them oot o' butter and
      milk and eggs, and a bit hen at times; mony a time I hae gie'n my ain
      dinner to thae gangrel bodies frae Glencro sooner nor hae them think there
      was nae rowth o' vivers whaur they never wer sent awa empty-haunded afore.
      I aye keepit my he'rt up wi' the notion that him doon-bye the coat belangs
      to wad hae made a match o't, and saved us a' frae beggary. But there's an
      end o' that, sorry am I. And sorry may you be; ye auld runt, to hear't,
      for he's been the guid enough friend to me; and there wad never hae been
      the Red Sodger Tavern for us if it wasnae for his interest in a man that
      has aye kep' up the airmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annapla seemed to find the dialect of Fife most pleasing and melodious.
      She listened to his monologue with approving smiles, and sitting on a
      stool, cowered within the arch, warming her hands at the apology for a
      flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha the deevil could hae tauld her it was the lad himsel' was here that
      nicht wi' his desperate chiels frae the barracks? It couldna' be you, for
      I didna' tell ye mysel' for fear ye wad bluitter it oot and spoil his
      chances. She kent onyway, and it was for no ither reason she gie'd him the
      route, unless&mdash;unless she had a notion o' the Frenchman frae the
      first glisk o' him. There's no accoontin' for tastes; clap a bunnet on a
      tawtie-bogle, wi' a cock to the ae side that's kin' o' knowin', and ony
      woman'll jump at his neck, though ye micht pap peas through the place
      whaur his wame should be. The Frenchy's no' my taste onyway; and noo,
      there's Sim! Just think o' Sim gettin' the dirty gae-bye frae a glaikit
      lassie hauf his age; and no' his equal in the three parishes, wi' a leg to
      tak' the ee o' a hal dancin'-school, and auld Knapdale's money comin' till
      him whenever Knapdale's gane, and I'm hearin' he's in the deid-thraws
      already. Ill fa' the day fotch the Frenchy! The race o' them never brocht
      ocht in my generation to puir Scotland worth a bodle, unless it micht be a
      new fricassee to fyle a stamach wi'. I'm fair bate to ken what this Coont
      wants here. 'Drimdarroch,' says he, but that's fair rideeculous, unless it
      was the real auld bauld Drimdarroch, and that's nae ither than Doom. I
      winna wonder if he heard o' Leevie ere ever he left the France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annapla began to drowse at the fire. He saw her head nod, and came round
      with the coat in his hand to confirm his suspicion that she was about to
      fall asleep. Her eyes were shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wauken up, Luckie!&rdquo; he cried, disgusted at this absence of appreciation.
      &ldquo;What ails the body? Ye're into your damnable dwaam again. There's them
      that's gowks enough to think ye're seein' Sichts, when it's neither mair
      nor less than he'rt-sick laziness, and I was ance ane o' them mysel'. Ye
      hinnae as muckle o' the Sicht as wad let ye see when Leevie was makin' a
      gowk o' ye to gar ye hang oot signals for her auld jo. A bonny-like
      brewster-wife ye'll mak', I warrant!&rdquo; He tapped her, not unkindly, on the
      head with the back of his brush, and brought her to earth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye listenin', ye auld runt?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm goin' doon to the toon i'
      the aifternoon wi' this braw coat and money for Monsher's inn accoont, and
      if ye're no' mair wide-awake by that time, there's deil the cries'll gae
      in wi' auld MacNair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman laughed, not at all displeased with herself nor with her rough
      admirer, and set to some trivial office. Mungo was finished with the coat;
      he held it out at arm's length, admiring its plenitude of lace, and
      finally put off his own hodden garment that he might try on the
      Chamberlain's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it fits me like an empty ale-cask. I thocht the Coont
      looked gey like a galo-shan in't, but I maun be the bonny doo mysel'. And
      I'm no that wee neither, for it's ticht aboot the back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annapla thought her diminutive admirer adorable; she stood raptly gazing
      on him, with her dish-clout dripping on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if there's no' a note or twa o' the New Bank i' the pouches,&rdquo;
       said Mungo, and began to search. Something in one of the pockets rustled
      to the touch, and with a face of great expectancy he drew forth what
      proved to be a letter. The seal was broken, there was neither an address
      nor the superscription of the writer; the handwriting was a faint Italian,
      betokening a lady&mdash;there was no delicate scrupulosity about the
      domestic, and the good Mungo unhesitatingly indulged himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no' exactly a note,&rdquo; said he, contracting his brows above the
      document. Not for the first time Annapla regretted her inability to read,
      as she craned over his shoulder to see what evidently created much
      astonishment in her future lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, that bates a'!&rdquo; he cried when he had finished, and he turned,
      visibly flushing, even through his apple-red complexion, to see Annapla at
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a guid thing the Sicht's nae use for English write,&rdquo; said he,
      replacing the letter carefully in the pocket whence it had come. &ldquo;This'll
      gae back to himsel', and naebody be nane the wiser o't for Mungo Byde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour he busied himself with aiding Annapla at the preparation
      of dinner, suddenly become silent as a consequence of what the letter had
      revealed to him, and then he went out to prepare his boat for his trip to
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annapla did not hesitate a moment; she fished out the letter and hurried
      with it to her master, less, it must be owned, from a desire to inform
      him, than from a womanly wish to share a secret that had apparently been
      of the greatest interest to Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom took it from her hands in an abstraction, for he was whelmed with the
      bitter prospect of imminent farewells; he carelessly scanned the sheet
      with half-closed eyes, and was well through perusing it before he realised
      that it had any interest. He began at the beginning again, caught the
      meaning of a sentence, sat bolt upright in the chair where Annapla had
      found him lolling, and finished with eagerness and astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where had she got this? She hesitated to tell him that it had been
      pilfered from the owner's pocket, and intimated that she had picked it up
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good woman,&rdquo; said he in Gaelic, &ldquo;you have picked up a fortune. It would
      have saved me much tribulation, and yourself some extra work, if you had
      happened to pick it up a month ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried to Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come upon the oddest secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His daughter reddened to the roots of her hair, and fell to trembling with
      inexplicable shame. He did not observe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that you have got out of the grip of the gled. Yon person was an
      even blacker villain than I guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, apparently much relieved, &ldquo;and is that your secret? I have
      no wonder left in me for any new display of wickedness from Simon
      MacTaggart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, and read her the damnatory document. She flushed, she
      trembled, she well-nigh wept with shame; but &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried at the end,
      &ldquo;is he not the noble man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noble man!&rdquo; cried Doom at such an irrelevant conclusion. &ldquo;Are you out
      of your wits, Olivia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stammered an explanation. &ldquo;I do not mean&mdash;I do not mean&mdash;this&mdash;wretch
      that is exposed here, but Count Victor. He has known it all along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; said Doom. &ldquo;I fancy he has. That was, like enough, the cause of the
      duel. But I do not think it was noble at all that he should keep silent
      upon a matter so closely affecting the happiness of your whole life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olivia saw this too, when helped to it, and bit her lip. It was,
      assuredly, not right that Count Victor, in the possession of such secrets
      as this letter revealed, should allow her to throw herself away on the
      villain there portrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have some reason we cannot guess,&rdquo; she said, and thought of one
      that made her heart beat wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No reason but a Frenchman's would let me lose my daughter to a scamp out
      of a pure punctilio. I can scarcely believe that he knew all that is in
      this letter. And you, my dear, you never guessed any more than I that
      these attacks under cover of night were the work of Simon MacTaggart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you the truth, father,&rdquo; said Olivia. &ldquo;I have known it since
      the second, and that it was that turned me. I learned from the button that
      Count Victor picked up on the stair, for I recognised it as his. I knew&mdash;I
      knew&mdash;and yet I wished to keep a doubt of it, I felt it so, and still
      would not confess it to myself that the man I loved&mdash;the man I
      thought I loved&mdash;was no better than a robber.&rdquo; &ldquo;A robber indeed! I
      thought the man bad; I never liked his eye and less his tongue, that was
      ever too plausible. Praise God, my dear, that he's found out!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI &mdash; LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was hours before Count Victor could trust himself and his tell-tale
      countenance before Olivia, and as he remained in an unaccustomed seclusion
      for the remainder of the day, she naturally believed him cold, though a
      woman with a fuller experience of his sex might have come to a different
      conclusion. Her misconception, so far from being dispelled when he joined
      her and her father in the evening, was confirmed, for his natural gaiety
      was gone, and an emotional constraint, made up of love, dubiety, and hope,
      kept him silent even in the precious moments when Doom retired to his
      reflections and his book, leaving them at the other end of the room alone.
      Nothing had been said about the letter; the Baron kept his counsel on it
      for a more fitting occasion, and though Olivia, who had taken its
      possession, turned it over many times in her pocket, its presentation
      involved too much boldness on her part to be undertaken in an impulse. The
      evening passed with inconceivable dulness; the gentleman was taciturn to
      clownishness; Mungo, who had come in once or twice to replenish fires and
      snuff candles, could not but look at them with wonder, for he plainly saw
      two foolish folks in a common misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the kitchen crying out his contempt for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If yon's coortin',&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's the drollest I ever clapt een on! The
      man micht be a carven image, and Leevie no better nor a shifty in the
      pook. I hope she disnae rue her change o' mind alreadys, for I'll warrant
      there was nane o' yon blateness aboot Sim MacTaggart, and it's no' what
      the puir lassie's been used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But these were speculations beyond the sibyl of his odd adoration; Annapla
      was too intent upon her own elderly love-affairs to be interested in those
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And upstairs, by now, a topic had at last come on between the silent pair
      that did not make for love or cheerfulness. The Baron had retired to his
      own room in the rear of the castle, and they had begun to talk of the
      departure that was now fixed for a date made imminent through the pressure
      of Petullo. Where were they bound for but France? Doom had decided upon
      Dunkerque because he had a half-brother there in a retirement compelled
      partly for political reasons Count Victor could appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;France!&rdquo; he cried, delighted. &ldquo;This is ravishing news indeed,
      Mademoiselle Olivia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she answered dubiously, reddening a little, and wondering why he
      should particularly think it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma foi! it is,&rdquo; he insisted heartily. &ldquo;I had the most disturbing visions
      of your wandering elsewhere. I declare I saw my dear Baron and his
      daughter immured in some pestilent Lowland burgh town, moping mountain
      creatures among narrow streets, in dreary tenements, with glimpse of
      neither sea nor tree to compensate them for pleasures lost. But France!&mdash;Mademoiselle
      has given me an exquisite delight. For, figure you! France is not so vast
      that friends may not meet there often&mdash;if one were so greatly
      privileged&mdash;and every roadway in it leads to Dunkerque&mdash;and&mdash;I
      should dearly love to think of you as, so to speak, in my neighbourhood,
      among the people I esteem. It is not your devoted Highlands, this France,
      Mademoiselle Olivia, but believe me, it has its charms. You shall not have
      the mountains&mdash;there I am distressed for you&mdash;nor yet the
      rivulets; and you must dispense with the mists; but there is ever the
      consolation of an air that is like wine in the head, and a frequent sun.
      France, indeed! <i>Je suis ravi!</i> I little thought when I heard of this
      end to the old home of you that you were to make the new one in my
      country; how could I guess when anticipating my farewell to the Highlands
      of Scotland that I should have such good company to the shore of France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are returning now?&rdquo; asked Olivia, her affectation of
      indifference just a little overdone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In very truth he had not, as yet, so determined; but he boldly lied like a
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas my intention to return at once. I cannot forgive myself for being
      so long away from my friends there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olivia had a bodice of paduasoy that came low upon her shoulders and
      showed a spray of jasmine in the cleft of her rounded breasts, which
      heaved with what Count Victor could not but perceive was some emotion. Her
      eyes were like a stag's, and they evaded him; she trifled with the pocket
      of her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is natural that you should weary here in this sorry
      place and wish to get back to the people you know. There will be many that
      have missed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few&mdash;a few, perhaps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Clancarty has doubtless often
      sought me vainly for the trivial coin: some butterflies in the <i>coulisse</i>
      of the playhouse will have missed my pouncet-box; but I swear there are
      few in Paris who would be inconsolable if Victor de Montaiglon never set
      foot on the <i>trottoir</i> again. It is my misfortune, mademoiselle, to
      have a multitude of friends so busy with content and pleasure&mdash;who
      will blame them?&mdash;that an absentee makes little difference, and as
      for relatives, not a single one except the Baroness de Chenier, who is
      large enough to count as double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there will be&mdash;there will be the lady,&rdquo; said Olivia, with a poor
      attempt at raillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he failed to grasp her allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said he hastily; &ldquo;I hope, indeed, to see <i>her</i>
      there.&rdquo; He felt an exaltation simply at the prospect. To see her there! To
      have a host's right to bid welcome to his land this fair wild-flower that
      had blossomed on rocks of the sea, unspoiled and unsophisticated!
    </p>
    <p>
      The jasmine stirred more obviously: it was fastened with a topaz brooch
      that had been her mother's, and had known of old a similar commotion; she
      became diligent with a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then there happened the thing that momentarily seemed a blow of
      fate to both of them. But for Mungo's voice at intervals in the kitchen,
      the house was wholly still, and through the calm winter night there came
      the opening bars of a melody, played very softly by Sim MacTaggart's
      flageolet. At first it seemed incredible&mdash;a caprice of imagination,
      and they listened for some moments speechless. Count Victor was naturally
      the least disturbed; this unlooked-for entertainment meant the pleasant
      fact that the Duchess had been nowise over-sanguine in her estimate of the
      Chamberlain's condition. Here was another possible homicide off his mind;
      the Gaelic frame was capable, obviously, of miraculous recuperation. That
      was but his first and momentary thought; the next was less pleasing, for
      it seemed not wholly unlikely now that after all Olivia and this man were
      still on an unchanged footing, and Mungo's sowing of false hopes was like
      to bring a bitter reaping of regretful disillusions. As for Olivia, she
      was first a flame and then an icicle. Her face scorched; her whole being
      seemed to take a sudden wild alarm. Count Victor dared scarcely look at
      her, fearing to learn his doom or spy on her embarrassment until her first
      alarm was over, when she drew her lips together tightly and assumed a
      frigid resolution. She made no other movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most bewitching flageolet! It languished on the night with an
      o'ermastering appeal, sweet inexpressibly and melting, the air unknown to
      one listener at least, but by him enviously confessed a very siren spell.
      He looked at Olivia, and saw that she intended to ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orpheus has recovered,&rdquo; he ventured with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared in front of her with no response; but the jasmine rose and
      fell, and her nostrils were abnormally dilated. Her face had turned from
      the red of her first surprise to the white of suppressed indignation. The
      situation was inconceivably embarrassing for both; now his bolt was shot,
      and unless she cared to express herself, he could not venture to allude to
      it again, though a whole orchestra augmented the efforts of the artist in
      the bower.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by there came a pause in the music, and she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the blackest of affronts this,&rdquo; was her comment, that seemed at
      once singular and sweet to her hearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>D'accord</i>,&rdquo; said Count Victor, but that was to himself. He was
      quite agreed that the Chamberlain's attentions, though well meant, were
      not for a good woman to plume herself on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flageolet spoke again&mdash;that curious unfinished air. Never before
      had it seemed so haunting and mysterious; a mingling of reproaches and
      command. It barely reached them where they sat together listening, a fairy
      thing and fascinating, yet it left the woman cold. And soon the serenade
      entirely ceased. Olivia recovered herself; Count Victor was greatly
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that is the end of it,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, poor Orpheus! he returns to Thrace, where perhaps Madame Petullo
      may lead the ladies in tearing him to pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once that hollow reed bewitched me, I fancy,&rdquo; said she with a shy air of
      confession; &ldquo;now I cannot but wonder and think shame at my blindness, for
      yon Orpheus has little beyond his music that is in any way admirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that the gift of nature, a thing without his own deserving, like his&mdash;like
      his regard for you, which was inevitable, Mademoiselle Olivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that the hollowest of all,&rdquo; she said, turning the evidence of it in
      her pocket again. &ldquo;He will as readily get over that as over his injury
      from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps 'tis so. The most sensitive man, they say, does not place all his
      existence on love; 'tis woman alone who can live and die in the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I daresay you speak from experience,&rdquo; said Olivia, smiling, but
      impatient that he should find a single plea in favour of a wretch he must
      know so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider me the exception,&rdquo; he hurried to explain. &ldquo;I never loved but
      once, and then would die for it.&rdquo; The jasmine trembled in its chaste white
      nunnery, and her lips were temptingly apart. He bent forward boldly,
      searching her provoking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the lucky lady!&rdquo; said Olivia in a low voice, and then a pause. She
      trifled with her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I wonder is that you could have a word to say of plea for this that
      surely is the blackest of his kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not admirable, by my faith! no; not admirable,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;but I
      would be the last to blame him for intemperately loving you. There, I
      think his honesty was beyond dispute; there he might have found salvation.
      That he should have done me the honour to desire my removal from your
      presence was flattering to my vanity, and a savage tribute to your power,
      Mademoiselle Olivia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Olivia, &ldquo;you cannot deceive me, Count Victor. It is odd that
      all your sex must stick up for each other in the greatest villanies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the greatest, Mademoiselle Olivia,&rdquo; said Count Victor with an
      inclination; &ldquo;he might have been indifferent to your charms, and that were
      the one thing unforgivable. But soberly, I consider his folly scarce bad
      enough for the punishment of your eternal condemnation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man thinks lightly indeed of me,&rdquo; thought Olivia. &ldquo;Drimdarroch has a
      good advocate,&rdquo; said she shortly, &ldquo;and the last I would have looked for in
      his defence was just yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drimdarroch?&rdquo; he repeated, in a puzzled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be telling me that you do not know?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For what did
      Simon MacTaggart harass our household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been bold enough to flatter myself; I had dared to think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him quickly, blushing. &ldquo;You know he was Drimdarroch, Count
      Victor,&rdquo; said she, with some conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped to his feet and bent to stare at her, his face all wrought with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Mademoiselle, you do not say the two were one? And yet&mdash;and
      yet&mdash;yes, <i>par dieu!</i> how blind I have been; there is every
      possibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you knew it,&rdquo; said Olivia, much relieved, &ldquo;and felt anything
      but pleased at your seeming readiness in the circumstances to let me be
      the victim of my ignorance. I had too much trust in the wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women distrust men too much in the general and too little in particular.
      And you knew?&rdquo; asked Count Victor. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learned to-day,&rdquo; said Olivia, &ldquo;and this was my bitter schooling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed him the letter. He took it and read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learned now,&rdquo; said the writer, &ldquo;the reason for your black looks at
      Monsher the wine merchant that has a Nobleman's Crest upon his belongings.
      It is because he has come to look for Drimdarroch. And the stupid body
      cannot find him! <i>We</i> know who Drimdarroch is, do we not, Sim?
      Monsher may have sharp eyes, but they do not see much further than a
      woman's face if the same comes in his way. And Simon MacTaggart (they're
      telling me) has been paying late visits to Doom Castle that were not for
      the love of Miss Milk-and-Water. Sim! Sim! I gave you credit for being
      less o' a Gomeral. To fetch the Frenchman to my house of all places! You
      might be sure he would not be long among our Indwellers here without his
      true business being discovered. Drimdarroch, indeed! Now I will hate the
      name, though I looked with a difference on it when I wrote it scores of
      times to your direction in the Rue Dauphine of Paris, and loved to dwell
      upon a picture of the place there that I had never seen, because my Sim
      (just fancy it!) was there. You were just a Wee Soon with the title, my
      dear Traitour, my bonny Spy. It might have been yours indeed, and more if
      you had patience, yes perhaps and Doom forby, as that is like to be my
      good-man's very speedily. What if I make trouble, Sim, and open the eyes
      of Monsher and the mim-mou'ed Madame at the same moment by telling them
      who is really Drimdarroch? Will it no' gar them Grue, think ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor stood amazed when he had read this. A confusion of feelings
      were in his breast. He had blundered blindly into his long-studied
      reprisals whose inadequate execution he was now scarce willing to regret,
      and Olivia had thought him capable of throwing her to this colossal rogue!
      The document shook in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Olivia at last. &ldquo;Is it a much blacker man that is there than
      the one you thought? I can tell you I will count it a disgrace to my
      father's daughter that she ever looked twice the road he was on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I can find it in me to forgive him the balance of his
      punishment,&rdquo; cried the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what for might that be?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Mademoiselle Olivia, he led me to Scotland and to your father's
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw a rapture in his manner, a kindling in his eye, and drew herself
      together with some pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were welcome to my father's door; I am sure of that of it, whatever,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;but it was a poor reward for so long a travelling. And now, my
      grief! We must steep the withies and go ourselves to the start of fortune
      like any beggars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; said he, and caught her hand that trembled in his like a bird.
      &ldquo;Olivia!&mdash;oh, God, the name is like a song&mdash;<i>je t'aime! je
      t'aime!</i> Olivia, I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She plucked her hand away and threw her shoulders back, haughty, yet
      trembling and on the brink of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not kind&mdash;it is not kind,&rdquo; she stammered, almost sobbing. &ldquo;The
      lady that is in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Petite imbecile!</i>&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there is no lady in France worthy to
      hold thy scarf; 'twas thyself, <i>mignonne</i>, I spoke of all the time;
      only the more I love the less I can express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her to him, crushing the jasmine till it breathed in a fragrant
      dissolution, bruising her breast with the topaz.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII &mdash; THE FUTILE FLAGEOLET
    </h2>
    <p>
      But Simon MacTaggart did not pipe wholly in vain. If Olivia was
      unresponsive, there was one at least in Doom who was his, whole-heartedly,
      and Mungo, when the flageolet made its vain appeal, felt a personal injury
      that the girl should subject his esteemed impersonation of all the manly
      graces and virtues&mdash;so to call them&mdash;to the insult of
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the melodies succeeded each other without a sign of response from
      overhead, he groaned, and swore with vexation and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye can be bummin' awa' wi' your chanter,&rdquo; he said as he stood listening
      in the kitchen. &ldquo;Her leddyship wodnae hae ye playin' there lang your lane
      a saison syne, but thae days is done wi'; there's nae lugs for a tirlin'
      at the winnock whaur there's nae love&mdash;at least wi' Mistress Leevie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annapla heard the music with a superstitious terror; her eyes threatened
      to leap out of her head, and she clutched the arm of her adorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gae 'wa!&rdquo; he told her, shaking her off with a contempt for her fears.
      &ldquo;Are ye still i' the daft Hielan' notion that it's a ghaist that's playin'
      there? That was a story he made up himsel', and the need for 't's done.
      There's naethin' waur nor Sim MacTaggart oot there i' the gairden, wastin'
      his wund on a wumman that's owre muckle ta'en up i' the noo wi' the
      whillywhaes o' a French sneckdrawer that haesnae the smeddum to gi'e her a
      toozlin' at the 'oor she needs it maist. Ay, ay! caw awa' wi' yer chanter,
      Sim, ye'll play hooly and fairly ere ever ye play 't i' the lug o' Leevie
      Lamond, and her heid against your shoulder again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When it seemed at last the player's patience was at an end, the little
      servitor took a lamp and went to the door. He drew the bolts softly,
      prepared to make a cautious emergence, with a recollection of his warm
      reception before. He was to have a great surprise, for there stood Simon
      Mac-Taggart leaning against the jamb&mdash;a figure of dejection!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod!&rdquo; cried Mungo, &ldquo;ye fair started me there, wi' your chafts like clay
      and yer ee'n luntin'. If I hadnae been tauld when I was doon wi' yer coat
      the day that ye was oot and aboot again, I wad hae taen 't for your
      wraith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain said nothing. There was something inexpressibly solemn in
      his aspect as he leaned wearily against the side of the door, his face
      like clay, as Mungo had truly said, and his eyes flaming in the light of
      the lantern. The flageolet was in his hand; he was shivering with cold.
      And he was silent. The silence of him was the most staggering fact for the
      little domestic, who would have been relieved to hear an oath or even have
      given his coat-collar to a vigorous shaking rather than be compelled to
      look on misery inarticulate. Simon looked past him into the shadows of the
      hall as a beggar looks into a garden where is no admission for him or his
      kind. A fancy seized Mungo that perhaps this dumb man had been drinking.
      &ldquo;He's gey like a man on the randan,&rdquo; he said to himself, peering
      cautiously, &ldquo;but he never had a name for the glass though namely for the
      lass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she in?&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, suddenly, without changing his
      attitude, and with scanty interest in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ay! She's in, sure enough,&rdquo; said Mungo. &ldquo;Whaur else wad she be but
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she'll have heard me?&rdquo; continued the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll warrant ye!&rdquo; said Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo pursed out his lips and shook his lantern. &ldquo;Ye can be askin' that,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Gude kens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain still leaned wearily against the door jamb, mentally
      whelmed by dejection, bodily weak as water. His ride on a horse along the
      coast had manifestly not been the most fitting exercise for a man new out
      of bed and the hands of his physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the foreigner?&rdquo; said he at length, and glowered the more into
      the interior as if he might espy him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo was cautious. This was the sort of person who on an impulse would
      rush the guard and create a commotion in the garrison; he temporised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foreigner?&rdquo; said he, as if there were so many in his experience that
      some discrimination was called for. &ldquo;Oh ay, the Coont. A gey queer birkie
      yon! He's no' awa yet. He's sittin' on his dowp yet, waitin' a
      dispensation o' Providence that'll gie him a heeze somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;he&mdash;is he with her?&rdquo; said Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thereaboots, thereaboots,&rdquo; admitted Mungo, cautiously. &ldquo;There's nae
      doot they're gey and chief got sin! he cam' back, and she foun' oot wha
      created the collieshangie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, man, and she kens that?&rdquo; said the Chamberlain with unnatural calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed does she, brawly! though hoo she kens is mair nor I can guess.
      Monsher thrieps it wasnae him, and I'll gie my oath it wasnae me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are kittle cattle, Mungo. There's whiles I think it a peety the old
      law against witchcraft was not still to the fore. And so she kent, did
      she? and nobody tell't her. Well, well!&rdquo; He laughed softly, with great
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mungo turned the lantern about in his hand and had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this I'm hearing about the Baron&mdash;the Baron and her&mdash;and
      her, leaving?&rdquo; said the Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the glide's truth that,&rdquo; said the little man; &ldquo;and for the oots and
      ins o't ye'll hae to ask Petullo doon-by, for he's at the root o't. Doom's
      done wi'; it's his decreet, and I'm no' a day ower soon wi' the promise o'
      the Red Sodger&mdash;for the which I'm muckle obleeged to you, Factor.
      Doom's done; they're gaun awa' in a week or twa, and me and Annapla's to
      be left ahint to steek the yetts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they tell me, Mungo; so they tell me,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, neither
      up nor down at this corroboration. &ldquo;In a week or twa! ay! ay! It'll be the
      bowrer nae langer then,&rdquo; he went on, unconsciously mimicking the Lowland
      Scots of the domestic. &ldquo;Do ye ken the auld song?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'O Bessie Bell and Mary Gray,
     They were twa bonnie lassies!
     They bigged a bower on yon burn-brae,
     And theekit it o'er wi' rashes.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He lilted the air with indiscreet indifference to being heard within; and
      &ldquo;Wheesh! man, wheesh!&rdquo; expostulated Mungo. &ldquo;If himsel' was to ken o' me
      colloguing wi' ye at the door at this 'oor o' the nicht, there wad be Auld
      Hornie to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there's like to be that the ways it is,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, never
      lifting his shoulder from the door-post, beating his leg with the
      flageolet, and in all with the appearance of a casual gossip reluctant to
      be going. &ldquo;Indeed, and by my troth! there's like to be that!&rdquo; he repeated.
      &ldquo;Do ye think, by the look of me, Mungo, I'm in a pleasant condition of
      mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith and ye look gey gash, sir,&rdquo; said Mungo; &ldquo;there's no denyin' that of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain gave a little crackling laugh, and held the flageolet like
      a dirk, flat along the inside of his arm and his fingers straining round
      the thick of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gash!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That's the way I feel. By God! Ye fetched down my coat
      to-day. It was the first hint I had that this damned dancing master was
      here, for he broke jyle; who would have guessed he was fool enough to come
      here, where&mdash;if we were in the key for it&mdash;we could easily set
      hands on him? He must have stolen the coat out of my own room; but that's
      no' all of it, for there was a letter in the pocket of it when it
      disappeared. What was in the letter I am fair beat to remember, but I know
      that it was of some importance to myself, and of a solemn secrecy, and it
      has not come back with the coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mungo was taken aback at this, but to acknowledge he had seen the letter
      at all would be to blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there was nae letter that I saw;&rdquo; and he concluded
      that he must have let it slip out of the pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain for the first time relinquished the support of the
      doorway, and stood upon his legs, but his face was more dejected than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said he, filling his chest with air. &ldquo;I had a small
      hope that maybe it might have come into your hands without the others
      seeing it, but that was expecting too much of a Frenchman. And the
      letter's away with it! My God! Away with it!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     '... Bigged a bower on yon burn-brae,
     And theekit it o'er wi' rashes!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For gude sake!&rdquo; said Mungo, terrified again at this mad lilting from a
      man who had anything but song upon his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're sure ye didnae see the letter?&rdquo; asked the Chamberlain again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amn't I tellin' ye?&rdquo; said Mungo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pity,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain, staring at the lantern, with eyes
      that saw nothing. &ldquo;In that case ye need not wonder that her ladyship inby
      should ken all, for I'm thinking it was a very informing bit letter,
      though the exact wording of it has slipped my recollection. It would be
      expecting over much of human nature to think that the foreigner would keep
      his hands out of the pouch of a coat he stole, and keep any secret he
      found there to himself. I'm saying, Mungo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody's got to sweat for this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was so much venom in the utterance and such a frenzy in the eye,
      that Mungo started; before he could find a comment the Chamberlain was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His horse was tethered to a thorn; he climbed wearily into the saddle and
      swept along the coast. At the hour of midnight his horse was stabled, and
      he himself was whistling in the rear of Petullo's house, a signal the
      woman there had thought never to hear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She responded in a joyful whisper from a window, and came down a few
      minutes later with her head in a capuchin hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sim! dear, is it you indeed? I could hardly believe my ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down the arms she would throw about his neck and held her wrists,
      squeezing them till she almost screamed with pain. He bent his face down
      to stare into her hood; even in the darkness she saw a plain fury in his
      eyes; if there was a doubt about his state of mind, the oath he uttered
      removed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; she gasped, struggling to free her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent me a letter on the morning of the ball?&rdquo; said he, a little
      relaxing his grasp, yet not altogether releasing her prisoned hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I did!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was in it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not delivered Jo you? I did not address it nor did I sign it, but
      I was assured you got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I got it has nothing to do with the matter, woman. What I want to
      know is what was in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you read it?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read it a score of times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And cursed two score of times as far as I remember; but what I am
      asking now is what was in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo began to weep softly, partly from the pain of the man's
      unconsciously cruel grasp, partly frotn disillusion, partly from a fear
      that she had to do with a mind deranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sim, have you forgotten already? It did not use to be that with a
      letter of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung away her hands and swore again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kate Cameron,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;damned black was the day I first clapt eyes
      on you! Tell me this, did your letter, that was through all my dreams when
      I was in the fever of my wound, and yet that I cannot recall a sentence
      of, say you knew I was Drimdarroch? It is in my mind that it did so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black the day you saw me, Sim!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I'm thinking it is just the
      other way about, my honest man. Drimdarroch! And spy, it seems, and
      something worse! And are you feared that I have clyped it all to Madame
      Milk-and-Water? No, Simon, I have not done that; I have gone about the
      thing another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another way,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I think I mind you threatened it before myself,
      and Doom is to be rouped at last to pleasure a wanton woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wanton woman! Oh, my excellent tutor! My best respects to my old
      dominie! I'll see day about with you for this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day about!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ftly good sweet-tempered Kate! You need not fash;
      your hand is played; your letter trumped the trick, and I am done. If that
      does not please your ladyship, you are ill to serve. And I would not just
      be saying that the game is finished altogether even yet, so long as I know
      where to lay my fingers on the Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She plucked her hands free, and ran from him without another word, glad
      for once of the sanctuary of a husband's door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII &mdash; A WARNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Petullo was from home. It was in such circumstances she found the bondage
      least intolerable. Now she was to find his absence more than a pleasant
      respite; it gave her an opportunity of warning Doom. She had scarce made
      up her mind how he should be informed of the jeopardies that menaced his
      guest, whose skaithless departure with Olivia was even, from her point of
      view, a thing wholly desirable, when the Baron appeared himself. It was
      not on the happiest of errands he came down on the first day of favouring
      weather; it was to surrender the last remnant of his right to the home of
      his ancestors. With the flourish of a quill he brought three centuries of
      notable history to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a lesson in humility, Mr. Campbell,&rdquo; said he to Petullo's clerk.
      &ldquo;We builded with the sword, and fell upon the sheep-skin. Who would think
      that so foolish a bird as the grey goose would have Doom and its
      generations in its wing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had about his shoulders a plaid that had once been of his tartan, but
      had undergone the degradation of the dye-pot for a foolish and tyrannical
      law; he threw it round him with a dignity that was half defiance, and cast
      his last glance round the scene of his sorriest experiences&mdash;the
      dusty writing-desks, the confusion of old letters; the taped and
      dog-eared, fouled, and forgotten records of pithy causes; and, finally, at
      the rampart of deed-chests, one of which had the name &ldquo;Drimdarroch&rdquo;
       blazoned on it for remembrance if he had been in danger of forgetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it yourself, Baron?&rdquo; cried a woman's voice as he turned to go. &ldquo;I
      am so sorry my husband is from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned again with his hat off for the lady who had an influence on his
      fate that he could never guess of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what is left of me, ma'am,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And it is more than is like
      to be seen of me in these parts for many a day to come,&rdquo; but with no
      complaint in his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I know; I know! and I am so sorry. You cannot leave
      to-day of any day without a glass of wine for <i>deoch-an-doruis</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, ma'am,&rdquo; said Doom, &ldquo;but my boat is at the quay, and Mungo
      waits for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, indeed, you must come in, Baron,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;There is something
      of the greatest importance I have to say to you, and it need not detain
      you ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her upstairs to her parlour. It was still early in the day and
      there was something of the slattern in her dragging gown. As he walked
      behind her, the remembrance would intrude of that betraying letter, and he
      had the notion that perhaps she somehow knew he shared her shameful
      secret. Nor was the idea dispelled when she stopped and faced him in the
      privacy of her room with her eyes swollen and a trembling under-lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it has come to this of it, Baron?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has come to this,&rdquo; said Doom simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you how vexed I am. But you know my husband&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, bowing with an old-fashioned
      inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;You know my husband, a hard man, Baron, though I perhaps should be
      the last to say it, and I have no say in his business affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is doubtless proper enough,&rdquo; said Doom, and thought of an irony
      breeding forbade him to give utterance to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must tell you I think it is a scandal you should have to go from
      the place of your inheritance; and your sweet girl too! I hope and trust
      she is in good health and spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good girl is very well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and with some reason for
      cheerfulness in spite of our misfortunes. As for them, ma'am, I am old
      enough to have seen and known a sufficiency of ups and downs, of flux and
      change, to wonder at none of them. I am not going to say that what has
      come to me is the most joco of happenings for a person like myself that
      has more than ordinary of the sentimentalist in me, and is bound to be
      wrapped up in the country-side hereabouts. But the tail may go with the
      hide, as the saying runs. Doom, that's no more than a heart-break of
      memories and an' empty shell, may very well join Duntorvil and Drimdarroch
      and the Islands of Lochow, that have dribbled through the courts of what
      they call the law and left me scarcely enough to bury myself in another
      country than my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo was not, in truth, wholly unmoved, but it was the actress in
      her wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you are going abroad,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That must be the hardest thing
      of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not complaining, ma'am,&rdquo; said Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; but oh! it is so sad, Baron&mdash;and your dear girl too, so
      sweet and nice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron grew impatient; the &ldquo;something of importance&rdquo; was rather long of
      finding an expression, and he took the liberty of interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, ma'am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there was something in particular you had
      to tell me. Mungo, as I mentioned, is waiting me at the quay, and time
      presses, for we have much to do before we leave next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of relief came to Mrs. Petullo's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, then, that goes far to set my mind at ease.&rdquo;
       Some colour came to her cheeks; she trifled with a handkerchief. &ldquo;What I
      wished to say, Baron, was that your daughter and&mdash;and&mdash;and the
      French gentleman, with whom we are glad to hear she is like to make a
      match of it, could not be away from this part of the country a day too
      soon. I overheard a curious thing the other day, it is only fair I should
      tell you, for it concerns your friend the French gentleman, and it was
      that Simon MacTaggart knew the Frenchman was back in your house and
      threatened trouble. There may be nothing in it, but I would not put it
      past the same person, who is capable of any wickedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the general belief, ma'am,&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;but I'll take your
      word for it, and, indeed, I have long had my own suspicions. Still, I
      think the same gentleman has had his wings so recently clipped that we
      need not be much put about at his threats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it on the best authority that he broods mischief,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best authority,&rdquo; repeated Doom, with never a doubt as to what that
      was. &ldquo;Well, it may be, but I have no fear of him. Once, I'll confess, he
      troubled me, but the man is now no more than a rotten kail-stock so far as
      my household is concerned. I thank God Olivia is happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so do I, I'm sure, with all my heart,&rdquo; chimed in the lady. &ldquo;And that
      is all the more reason why the Count&mdash;you see we know his station&mdash;should
      be speedily out of the way of molestation, either from the law or Simon
      MacTaggart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doom made to bring the interview to a conclusion. &ldquo;As to the Count,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;you can take my word for it, he is very well able to look after
      himself, as Drimdarroch, or MacTaggart, or whatever is the Chamberlain's
      whim to call himself, knows very well by now. Drimdarroch, indeed! I could
      be kicking him myself for his fouling of an honest old name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kicking!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I wonder at your leniency. I cannot but think you
      are far from knowing the worst of Simon MacTaggart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst!&rdquo; said Doom. &ldquo;That's between himself and Hell, but I know as
      much as most, and it's enough to make me sure the man's as boss as an
      empty barrel. He was once a sort of friend of mine, till twenty years ago
      my wife grew to hate the very mention of his name. Since then I've seen
      enough of him at a distance to read the plausible rogue in his very step.
      The man wears every bawbee virtue he has like a brooch in his bonnet; and
      now when I think of it, I would not dirty my boots with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Petullo's lips parted. She hovered a second or two on a disclosure
      that explained the wife's antipathy of twenty years ago, but it involved
      confession of too intimate a footing on her own part with the Chamberlain,
      and she said no more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX &mdash; BETRAYED BY A BALLAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days passed and a rumour went about the town, in its origin as
      indiscoverable as the birthplace of the winds. It engaged the seamen on
      the tiny trading vessels at the quay, and excited the eagerest speculation
      in Ludovic's inn. Women put down their water-stoups at the wells and shook
      mysterious heads over hints of Sim MacTaggart's history. No one for a
      while had a definite story, but in all the innuendoes the Chamberlain
      figured vaguely as an evil influence. That he had slain a man in some
      parts abroad was the first and the least astonishing of the crimes laid to
      his charge, though the fact that he had never made a brag of it was
      counted sinister; but, by-and-by, surmise and sheer imagination gave place
      to a commonly accepted tale that Simon had figured in divers escapades in
      France with the name Drimdarroch; that he had betrayed men and women
      there, and that the Frenchman had come purposely to Scotland seeking for
      him. It is the most common of experiences that the world will look for
      years upon a man admiringly and still be able to recall a million things
      to his discredit when he is impeached with some authority. It was so in
      this case. The very folks who had loved best to hear the engaging
      flageolet, feeling the springs of some nobility bubble up in them at the
      bidding of its player, and drunk with him and laughed with him and ever
      esteemed his free gentility, were the readiest to recall features of his
      character and incidents of his life that&mdash;as they put it&mdash;ought
      to have set honest men upon their guard. The tale went seaward on the
      gabbards, and landward, even to Lorn itself, upon carriers' carts and as
      the richest part of the packman's budget. Furthermore, a song or two was
      made upon the thing, that even yet old women can recall in broken stanzas,
      and of one of these, by far the best informed, Petullo's clerk was the
      reputed author.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, the object of the scandal was for a while unconscious. He went
      about experiencing a new aloofness in his umquhile friends, and finally
      concluded that it was due to his poor performance in front of the
      foreigner on the morning of the ball, and that but made him the more
      venomously ruminant upon revenge. In these days he haunted the avenues
      like a spirit, brooding on his injuries, pondering the means of a
      retaliation; there were no hours of manumission in the inn; the reed was
      still. And yet, to do him justice, there was even then the frank and suave
      exterior; no boorish awkward silence in his ancient gossips made him lose
      his jocularity; he continued to embellish his conversation with morals
      based on universal kindness and goodwill.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the thunder broke, for the scandal reached the castle, and was
      there overheard by the Duchess in a verse of the ballad sung under her
      window by a gardener's boy. She made some inquiries, and thereafter went
      straight to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this I hear about your Chamberlain?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argyll drew down his brows and sighed. &ldquo;My Chamberlain?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It must
      be something dreadful by the look of her grace the Duchess. What is it
      this time? High treason, or marriage, or the need of it? Or has old
      Knapdale died by a blessed disposition and left him a fortune? That would
      save me the performance of a very unpleasant duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has gone the length of scurrilous songs about our worthy gentleman.
      The town has been ringing with scandals about him for a week, and I never
      heard a word about it till half-an-hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you feel defrauded, my dear, which is natural enough, being a
      woman as well as a duchess. I am glad to know that so squalid a story
      should be so long of reaching your ears; had it been anything to anybody's
      credit you would have been the first to learn of it. To tell the truth,
      I've heard the song myself, and if I have seemed unnaturally engaged for a
      day or two it is because I have been in a quandary as to what I should do.
      Now that you know the story, what do you advise, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere woman must leave that to the Lord Justice-General,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;And now that your Chamberlain turns out a greater scamp than I thought
      him, I'm foolish enough to be sorry for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; said the Duke, and looked about the shelves of books lining
      the room. &ldquo;Here's a multitude of counsellors, a great deal of the world's
      wisdom so far as it has been reduced to print, and I'll swear I could go
      through it from end to end without learning how I should judge a problem
      like Sim MacTaggart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have left him then, but he stopped her with a smiling
      interrogation. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the customary privilege?&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you have not said 'I told you so.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at that. &ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh! but you forgave my
      Frenchman, and for that I owe you some consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I, faith?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;'Twas mighty near the compounding of a felony, a
      shocking lapse in a Justice-General. To tell the truth, I was only too
      glad, in MacTaggart's interest, while he was ill, to postpone disclosures
      so unpleasant as are now the talk of the country; and like you, I find him
      infinitely worse in these disclosures than I guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess went away, the Duke grew grave, reflecting on his duty. What
      it clearly was he had not decided until it was late in the evening, and
      then he sent for his Chamberlain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL &mdash; THE DAY OF JUDGMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Simon went to the library and saw plainly that the storm was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Simon, sit down,&rdquo; said his Grace and carefully sharped a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain subsided in a chair; crossed his legs; made a mouth as if
      to whistle. There was a vexatious silence in the room till the Duke got up
      and stood against the chimney-piece and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could be taking a liberty with the old song and
      singing 'Roguery Parts Good Company' if I were not, so far as music goes,
      as timber as the table there and in anything but a key for music even if I
      had the faculty. Talking about music, you have doubtless not heard the
      ingenious ballant connected with your name and your exploits. It has been
      the means of informing her Grace upon matters I had preferred she knew
      nothing about, because I liked to have the women I regard believe the
      world much better than it is. And it follows that you and I must bring our
      long connection to an end. When will it be most convenient for my
      Chamberlain to send me his resignation after 'twelve years of painstaking
      and intelligent service to the Estate,' as we might be saying, on the
      customary silver salver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon cursed within but outwardly never quailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about a ballant,&rdquo; said he coolly, &ldquo;but as for the rest of
      it, I thank God I can be taking a hint as ready as the quickest. Your
      Grace no doubt has reasons. And I'll make bold to say the inscription it
      is your humour to suggest would not be anyway extravagant, for the twelve
      years have been painstaking enough, whatever about their intelligence, of
      which I must not be the judge myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as that goes, sir,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;you have been a pattern. And
      it is your gifts that make your sins the more heinous; a man of a more
      sluggish intelligence might have had the ghost of an excuse for failing to
      appreciate the utmost loathsomeness of his sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by the Lord Harry, if it is to be a sermon&mdash;!&rdquo; cried Simon,
      jumping to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your chair, sir! keep your chair like a man!&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;I am
      thinking you know me well enough to believe there is none of the common
      moralist about me. I leave the preaching to those with a better conceit of
      themselves than I could afford to have of my indifferent self. No
      preaching, cousin, no preaching, but just a word among friends, even if it
      were only to explain the reason for our separation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain resumed his chair defiantly and folded his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be cursed if I see the need for all this preamble,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but
      your Grace can fire away. It need never be said that Simon MacTaggart was
      feared to account for himself when the need happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within certain limitations, I daresay that is true,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I aye liked a tale to come to a brisk conclusion,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain,
      with no effort to conceal his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one will be as brisk as I can make it,&rdquo; said his Grace. &ldquo;Up till the
      other day I gave you credit for the virtue you claim&mdash;the readiness
      to answer for yourself when the need happened. I was under the delusion
      that your duel with the Frenchman was the proof of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn the Frenchman!&rdquo; cried the Chamberlain with contempt and
      irritation. &ldquo;I am ready to meet the man again with any arm he chooses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With any arm!&rdquo; said the Duke dryly. &ldquo;'Tis always well to have a whole
      one, and not one with a festering sore, as on the last occasion. Oh yes,&rdquo;
       he went on, seeing Simon change colour, &ldquo;you observe I have learned about
      the old wound, and what is more, I know exactly where you got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace seems to have trustworthy informants,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain
      less boldly, but in no measure abashed. &ldquo;I got that wound through your own
      hand as surely as if you had held the foil that gave it, for the whole of
      this has risen, as you ought to know, from your sending me to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is true, in a sense, my good sophist. But I was, in that, the
      unconscious and blameless link in your accursed destiny. I had you sent to
      France on a plain mission. It was not, I make bold to say, a mission on
      which the Government would have sent any man but a shrewd one and a
      gentleman, and I was mad enough to think Simon Mac-Taggart was both. When
      you were in Paris as our agent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fah!&rdquo; cried Simon, snapping his fingers and drawing his face in a
      grimace. &ldquo;Agent, quo' he! for God's sake take your share of it and say spy
      and be done with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke shrugged his shoulders, listening patiently to the interruption.
      &ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let us say spy, then. You were to learn what you
      could of the Pretender's movements, and incidentally you were to intromit
      with certain of our settled agents at Versailles. Doubtless a sort of
      espionage was necessary to the same. But I make bold to say the duty was
      no ignoble one so long as it was done with some sincerity and courage, for
      I count the spy in an enemy's country is engaged upon the gallantest
      enterprise of war, using the shrewdness that alone differs the quarrel of
      the man from the fury of the beast, and himself the more admirable,
      because his task is a thousand times more dangerous than if he fought with
      the claymore in the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless! doubtless!&rdquo; said the Chamberlain. &ldquo;That's an old tale between
      the two of us, but you should hear the other side upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; we gave you the credit and the reward of doing your duty as
      you engaged, and yet you mixed the business up with some extremely dirty
      work no sophistry of yours or mine will dare defend. You took our money,
      MacTaggart&mdash;and you sold us! Sit down, sit down and listen like a
      man! You sold us; there's the long and the short of it, and you sold our
      friends at Versailles to the very people you were sent yourself to act
      against. Countersap with a vengeance! We know now where Bertin got his
      information. You betrayed us and the woman Cecile Favart in the one filthy
      transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chamberlain showed in his face that the blow was home. His mouth broke
      and he grew as grey as a rag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's the way of it?&rdquo; he said, after a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way of it,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;She was as much the agent&mdash;let
      us say the spy, then&mdash;as you were yourself, and seems to have brought
      more cunning to the trade than did our simple Simon himself. If her friend
      Montaiglon had not come here to look for you, and thereby put us on an old
      trail we had abandoned, we would never have guessed the source of her
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be cursed if I have a dog's luck!&rdquo; cried Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argyll looked pityingly at him. &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You mind our old country
      saying, <i>Ni droch dhuine dàn da féin</i>&mdash;a bad man makes his own
      fate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say so?&rdquo; cried MacTaggart, with his first sign of actual
      insolence, and the Duke sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good Simon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do not require to tell you so, for you know
      it very well. What I would add is that all I have said is, so far as I am
      concerned, between ourselves; that's my only tribute to our old
      acquaintanceship. Only I can afford to have no more night escapades at
      Doom or anywhere else with my fencibles, and so, Simon, the resignation
      cannot be a day too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid that I should delay it a second longer than is desirable,
      and your Grace has it here and now! A fine <i>fracas</i> all this about a
      puddock-eating Frenchman! I do not value him nor his race to the extent of
      a pin. And as for your Grace's Chamberlain&mdash;well, Simon MacTaggart
      has done very well hitherto on his own works and merits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may find, for all that,&rdquo; says his Grace, &ldquo;that they were all summed
      up in a few words&mdash;'he was a far-out cousin to the Duke.' <i>Sic itur
      ad astra</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Simon put on his hat and laughed with an eerie and unpleasant
      stridency. He never said another word, but left the room. The sound of his
      unnatural merriment rang on the stair as he descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is fey,&rdquo; said the Duke to himself, listening with a startled
      gravity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI &mdash; CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Simon MacTaggart went out possessed by the devils of hatred and chagrin.
      He saw himself plainly for what he was in truth&mdash;a pricked bladder,
      his career come to an ignoble conclusion, the single honest scheme he had
      ever set his heart on brought to nought, and his vanity already wounded
      sorely at the prospect of a contemptuous world to be faced for the
      remainder of his days. All this from the romantics of a Frenchman who
      walked through life in the step of a polonaise, and a short season ago was
      utterly unaware that such a man as Simon MacTaggart existed, or that a
      woman named Olivia bloomed, a very flower, among the wilds! At whatever
      angle he viewed the congregated disasters of the past few weeks, he saw
      Count Victor in their background&mdash;a sardonic, smiling, light-hearted
      Nemesis; and if he detested him previously as a merely possible danger, he
      hated him now with every fibre of his being as the cause of his upheaval.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in this way that is not uncommon with the sinner, he must pity
      himself because circumstances had so consistently conspired against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come into the garden after the interview with Argyll had made it
      plain that the darkest passages in his servant's history were known to
      him, and had taken off his hat to get the night breeze on his brow which
      was wet with perspiration. The snow was still on the ground; among the
      laden bushes, the silent soaring trees of fir and ash, it seemed as if
      this was no other than the land of outer darkness whereto the lost are
      driven at the end. It maddened him to think of what he had been brought
      to; he shook his fist in a childish and impotent petulance at the spacious
      unregarding east where Doom lay&mdash;the scene of all his passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's curse on the breed of meddlers!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Another month and I was
      out of these gutters and hell no more to tempt me. To be the douce
      good-man, and all the tales of storm forgotten by the neighbours that may
      have kent them; to sit perhaps with bairns&mdash;her bairns and mine&mdash;about
      my knee, and never a twinge of the old damnable inclinations, and the
      flageolet going to the honestest tunes. All lost! All lost for a rat that
      takes to the hold of an infernal ship, and comes here to chew at the ropes
      that dragged me to salvation. This is where it ends! It's the judgment
      come a day ower soon for Sim MacTaggart. But Sim MacTaggart will make the
      rat rue his meddling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had come out with no fixed idea of what he next should do, but one step
      seemed now imperative&mdash;he must go to Doom, otherwise his blood would
      burst every vein in his body. He set forth with the stimulus of fury for
      the barracks where his men lay, of whom half-a-dozen at least were his to
      the gate of the Pit itself, less scrupulous even than himself because more
      ignorant, possessed of but one or two impulses&mdash;a foolish affection
      for him and an inherited regard for rapine too rarely to be indulged in
      these tame latter days. To call them out, to find them armed and ready for
      any enterprise of his was a matter of brief time. They set out knowing
      nothing at all of his object, and indifferent so long as this adorable
      gentleman was to lead them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came to Doom the tide was full and round about it, so they
      retired upon the hillside, sheltering in a little plantation of fir
      through which they could see the stars, and Doom dense black against them
      without a sign of habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Doom, upon the side that faced the sea, was not asleep. Mungo was
      busy upon the preparations for departure, performing them in a funereal
      spirit, whimpering about the vacant rooms with a grief that was trivial
      compared with that of Doom itself, who waited for the dawn as if it were
      to bring him to the block, or of Olivia, whose pillow was wet with
      unavailing tears. It was their last night in Doom. At daybreak Mungo was
      to convey them to the harbour, where they should embark upon the vessel
      that was to bear them to the lowlands. It seemed as if the sea-gulls came
      earlier than usual to wheel and cry about the rock, half-guessing that it
      was so soon to be untenanted, and finally, as it is to-day, the
      grass-grown mound of memories. Olivia rose and went to her window to look
      out at them, and saw them as yet but vague grey floating shapes slanting
      against the paling stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the household rose; the boat nodded to the leeward of the rock,
      with its mast stepped, its sail billowing with a rustle in the faint air,
      and Mungo at the sheet. The dawn came slowly, but fast enough for the
      departing, and the landward portion of the rock was still in shadow when
      Olivia stepped forth with a tear-stained face and a trembling hand on
      Victor's arm. He shared her sorrow, but was proud and happy too that her
      trials, as he hoped, were over. They took their seat in the boat and
      waited for the Baron. Now the tide was down, the last of it running in
      tiny rivulets upon the sand between the mainland and the rock, and Simon
      and his gang came over silently. Simon led, and turned the corner of the
      tower hastily with his sword in his hand to find the Baron emerging. He
      had not seen the boat and its occupants, but the situation seemed to flash
      upon him, and he uttered a cry of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doom drew back under the frowning eyebrow of what had been his home,
      tugged the weapon from his scabbard, and threw himself on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is kind, indeed,&rdquo; he said in a pause of his assailant's confusion at
      finding this was not the man he sought. &ldquo;You have come to say 'Goodbye.'
      On guard, black dog, on guard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>So dhuit maat!</i>&mdash;here then is for you,&rdquo; cried Sim, and waving
      back his followers, engaged with a rasp of steel. It lasted but a moment:
      Doom crouched a little upon bending knees, with a straight arm, parrying
      the assault of a point that flew in wild disorder. He broke ground for a
      few yards with feints in quarte. He followed on a riposte with a lunge&mdash;short,
      sharp, conclusive, for it took his victim in the chest and passed through
      at the other side with a thud of the hilt against his body. Sim fell with
      a groan, his company clustering round him, not wholly forgetful of
      retaliation, but influenced by his hand that forbade their interference
      with his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean up your filth!&rdquo; said Doom in the Gaelic, sheathing his sword and
      turning to join his daughter. &ldquo;He took Drimdarroch from me, and now, by
      God! he's welcome to Doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not our old friends, surely?&rdquo; said Count Victor, looking backward at the
      cluster of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Doom, and kept his counsel further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Victor put his arm round Olivia's waist. The boat's prow fell off;
      the sail filled; she ran with a pleasant ripple through the waves, and
      there followed her a cry that only Doom of all the company knew was a
      coronach, followed by the music of Sim MacTaggart's flageolet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rose above the ripple of the waves, above the screaming of the birds,
      finally stilling the coronach, and the air it gave an utterance to was the
      same that had often charmed the midnight bower, failing at the last
      abruptly as it had always done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens! it is my Mary's favourite air, and that was all she knew of
      it,&rdquo; said Doom, and his face grew white with memory and a speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he found the end of that air,&rdquo; said Count Victor, &ldquo;he had found, as
      he said himself, another man. But I, perhaps, had never found Olivia!&rdquo;
